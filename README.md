# Dicetrix

A sophisticated multi-die Tetris-like puzzle game that combines falling Tetromino pieces made of dice with strategic number matching. Built for Reddit using Phaser.js and the Devvit platform, Dicetrix features multi-die pieces (like Tetris blocks) that spawn and fall down a 10x20 grid, where players can control piece movement, rotation, and placement before they lock into place and create matches when 3 or more adjacent dice show the same numbers.

## What is Dicetrix?

Dicetrix is an innovative puzzle game that merges Tetris-style piece mechanics with dice-based matching gameplay. Multi-die pieces (containing 1-4 dice in various Tetromino shapes like single, line, L-shape, square, and T-shape) spawn at the top center of a 10x20 grid. Players can move, rotate, and drop these pieces strategically before they lock into place. Each die shows a random number based on its type (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20-sided dice depending on difficulty mode). When pieces lock, the game uses an advanced flood-fill algorithm to detect groups of 3 or more adjacent dice with matching numbers, automatically clearing them and causing remaining dice to fall due to gravity, creating satisfying cascade chain reactions.

The game features clean visual design with procedurally rendered dice, responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, and complete scene management. Built specifically for Reddit's Devvit platform, it runs seamlessly within Reddit posts and provides an engaging puzzle experience combining spatial reasoning (Tetris-like placement) with pattern matching (dice numbers).

**Current Status**: Dicetrix is a fully functional multi-die puzzle game with sophisticated Tetromino piece mechanics, real-time grid rendering, advanced match detection logic, and gravity-based cascade system. The game includes complete scene flow (Boot ‚Üí Preloader ‚Üí StartMenu ‚Üí Game ‚Üí GameOver) with working multi-die piece spawning, falling, player controls (move, rotate, drop), locking, match detection, clearing, and cascade mechanics. Players can control piece movement using on-screen controls with full rotation and placement strategy.

## Game Overview

Dicetrix is a multi-die Tetris-like puzzle game where Tetromino pieces made of dice drop from the top center of a 10x20 grid at configurable intervals (400-1200ms depending on difficulty mode). Each piece contains 1-4 dice arranged in classic Tetromino shapes (single, line, L-shape, square, T-shape, etc.). Each die shows a random number based on its type (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20-sided dice depending on selected difficulty mode). Players can control the falling pieces using movement controls (left/right), rotation (clockwise/counter-clockwise), soft drop, and hard drop before they lock into the grid. When pieces lock into position, the game uses advanced flood-fill algorithms to detect groups of 3 or more adjacent dice with matching numbers and clears them instantly, causing remaining dice to fall due to gravity and potentially create satisfying cascade chain reactions.

The core gameplay focuses on **strategic piece placement and rotation** - players control falling multi-die pieces to create optimal matching opportunities and cascade setups. The game combines Tetris-style spatial reasoning with dice-based pattern matching. Different dice types create varying probability distributions for matches (d4 creates more frequent matches than d20). Combined with gravity effects that cause dice to fall after matches are cleared (except in Zen mode), Dicetrix offers a unique puzzle experience that emphasizes strategic placement, rotation planning, pattern recognition, and cascade chain setup.

## What Makes Dicetrix Innovative?

## How to Play Dicetrix

Dicetrix is a strategic multi-die puzzle game that combines Tetris-style piece mechanics with dice-based matching. You control falling multi-die Tetromino pieces to create matches and cascade reactions. Here's everything you need to know:

### üéØ Basic Gameplay

**Objective**: Control falling multi-die Tetromino pieces to create groups of 3 or more adjacent dice with matching numbers. Clear matches to score points and prevent the grid from filling up.

**Game Flow**:
1. Multi-die pieces (containing 1-4 dice in Tetromino shapes) spawn at the top center of the 10x20 grid
2. Use controls to move, rotate, and drop pieces strategically before they lock
3. When 3+ adjacent dice show the same number, they automatically clear
4. Remaining dice fall due to gravity, potentially creating cascade chains
5. Continue until the grid fills to the top

**Piece Types**: 8 different Tetromino shapes containing dice:
- **Single**: 1 die for precise placement
- **Line2**: 2 dice in a straight line
- **Line3**: 3 dice in a straight line  
- **Line4**: 4 dice in a straight line
- **L3**: 3 dice in L formation (corner piece)
- **L4**: 4 dice in larger L formation
- **Square**: 4 dice in 2x2 formation (most stable)
- **T-Shape**: 4 dice in T formation (versatile placement)

### üéÆ Controls

**On-Screen Controls** (Touch & Mouse):
- **‚Üê ‚Üí**: Move multi-die piece left/right across the grid
- **‚Ü∫ ‚Üª**: Rotate piece counter-clockwise/clockwise (90¬∞ increments with collision detection)
