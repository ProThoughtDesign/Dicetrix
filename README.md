# Dicetrix

A revolutionary gravity-matching puzzle game that combines falling Tetromino pieces with advanced dice-based match detection and clearing mechanics. Built for Reddit using Phaser.js and the Devvit platform, creating an entirely new puzzle gaming experience.

## What is Dicetrix?

Dicetrix is a complete, fully playable puzzle game that creates an entirely new gaming experience by merging classic falling-block mechanics with innovative dice-matching gameplay. Players control Tetromino pieces (I, O, T, L, J, S, Z, and PLUS shapes) made of SimpleDie objects that fall into a 10x20 grid. When pieces lock into place, the game uses an advanced flood-fill algorithm to detect groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers and clears them, triggering gravity effects and potential cascade chains.

The game features a sophisticated finite state machine architecture with autonomous dice movement, intelligent responsive design that adapts to any screen size, and professional-grade visual and audio systems. Built specifically for Reddit's Devvit platform, it runs seamlessly within Reddit posts and provides an engaging puzzle experience for the Reddit community.

**Current Status**: Dicetrix is a complete, production-ready gravity-matching puzzle game featuring autonomous dice movement managed by a GameStateController finite state machine, real-time responsive design across all devices, advanced match detection with size-based effects, comprehensive input systems for desktop and mobile, and smooth animations with professional visual polish.

## What Makes Dicetrix Innovative?

### üéØ Revolutionary Hybrid Gameplay System

Dicetrix creates an entirely new puzzle genre by seamlessly combining two beloved game mechanics into something completely unique:

**Tetromino Control + Dice Matching = New Gaming Experience**
- Control 8 different Tetromino shapes: I, O, T, L, J, S, Z, plus a custom PLUS shape
- Each piece is composed of SimpleDie objects showing random numbers (4-20 sides depending on difficulty)
- When pieces lock into place, an advanced flood-fill algorithm detects groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers
- Creates a strategic depth where players must consider both piece placement AND number matching

**Advanced Dice System with Strategic Depth**
- **Regular Dice**: Show numbers 1-20 based on game mode difficulty (Easy: 4-6 sides, Expert: 4-20 sides)
- **Wild Dice (*)**: Match with any number, created by clearing 5+ dice groups - the key to massive combos
- **Black Dice (X)**: Remove active color boosters when matched (Hard/Expert modes only) - adds risk/reward
- **Size-Based Effects**: Different match sizes trigger unique clearing effects:
  - **3 Dice**: Standard clear (removes matched dice only)
  - **4 Dice**: Line clear (removes entire row or column)
  - **5 Dice**: Wild spawn (creates a Wild die at match center)
  - **7 Dice**: Area clear (removes 7x7 area around match)
  - **9+ Dice**: Grid clear (removes all dice from playing field)
- **Ultimate Combo**: 3+ adjacent Wild dice upgrade all grid dice to maximum values with 5x score multiplier

### üöÄ Autonomous Dice Architecture Innovation

**Self-Managing Game Objects**
- **SimpleDie Architecture**: Each die is a self-contained Phaser.GameObjects.Container that manages its own rendering, movement, and lifecycle through proper object-oriented design
- **MovementManager**: Sophisticated tracking system with explicit registration/unregistration that emits events when all movement completes
- **Event-Driven Flow**: GameStateController uses Phaser's EventEmitter to coordinate piece locking, autonomous dice falling, match processing, and cascade chains
- **Natural Autonomy**: After piece locking, dice become autonomous and handle their own falling behavior through Phaser's built-in preUpdate() system - no complex coordination needed

### üéÆ Finite State Machine Game Architecture

**GameStateController - Professional Game Flow Management**
- Uses Phaser's EventEmitter system with finite state machine architecture to coordinate all game flow
- **Game Phases**: SPAWN ‚Üí DROP_CONTROL ‚Üí LOCK ‚Üí MATCH ‚Üí CLEAR_MATCH ‚Üí CASCADE
- **Input State Management**: Automatically enables/disables input based on game phase to prevent conflicts
- **Event-Driven Coordination**: Coordinates piece locking, gravity application, match processing, and cascade chains through clean event communication
- **Autonomous Integration**: When pieces lock, dice become autonomous and manage their own falling behavior while the state machine coordinates the overall flow
- **Clean Architecture**: Eliminates complex state management by using event-driven communication between systems

### üì± Intelligent Cross-Platform Design

**Real-Time Responsive Adaptation**
- **Automatic Display Detection**: Classifies screen sizes into mobile (‚â§1080px), desktop (‚â§1600px), and fullscreen (>1600px) modes

#### üé≤ Actual Game Mechanics in Action

**Finite State Machine Flow**
- GameStateController manages 6 distinct phases: SPAWN ‚Üí DROP_CONTROL ‚Üí LOCK ‚Üí MATCH ‚Üí CLEAR_MATCH ‚Üí CASCADE
- Each phase transition is event-driven with proper timeout handling (5 second safety timeout per phase)
- Input is automatically enabled only during DROP_CONTROL phase and disabled during all processing phases
- Phase transitions emit events for coordination between game systems

**Piece Movement & Control (DROP_CONTROL Phase)**
- Pieces spawn at the top center (gridX=4) of the 10x20 grid and fall automatically every 1000ms (Easy mode)
- Real-time collision detection prevents pieces from moving into occupied spaces or outside grid boundaries
- Rotation uses a matrix transformation system with wall kick attempts (-1, 1, -2, 2 grid positions) if rotation is blocked
- Hard drop instantly moves pieces to the lowest valid position and locks them immediately
- When piece can't move down, GameStateController.lockCurrentPiece() is called to transition to LOCK phase

**Autonomous Dice System (LOCK ‚Üí CASCADE Phases)**
- During LOCK phase, each SimpleDie is placed in the grid and becomes autonomous
- Dice register with MovementManager and handle their own falling behavior through Phaser's preUpdate() system
- MovementManager tracks all moving dice with explicit registration/unregistration
- CASCADE phase waits for MovementManager to emit 'allMovementComplete' before proceeding

**Match Detection & Processing (MATCH ‚Üí CLEAR_MATCH Phases)**
- MATCH phase: MatchProcessor uses flood-fill algorithm to detect connected groups of 3+ dice with matching numbers
- Wild dice (*) match with any number, making them valuable for completing difficult matches
- CLEAR_MATCH phase: Size-based effects trigger automatically based on match size
- Ultimate Combo activates when 3+ Wild dice are adjacent, upgrading all grid dice with 5x score multiplier

**Event-Driven Cascade System (CASCADE Phase)**
- After matches clear, CASCADE phase applies gravity to all remaining dice
- Each die falls autonomously to its lowest valid position
- Chain multiplier increases using floor(log2(chain_index)) formula for each cascade level
- Cascades continue up to 10 levels maximum, cycling between CASCADE ‚Üí MATCH phases
- Returns to SPAWN phase only when no more matches are found

### üéØ Step-by-Step Gameplay Guide

#### Phase 1: Piece Control (DROP_CONTROL)
- **Tetromino pieces** (I, O, T, L, J, S, Z, PLUS) spawn at the top center of the 10x20 grid
- Each piece contains **SimpleDie objects** showing random numbers (4-20 sides based on difficulty)
- Use controls to **position and rotate** pieces as they fall with gravity
- Pieces automatically fall at timed intervals (1000ms in Easy mode)
- **Real-time collision detection** prevents invalid movements
- **GameStateController** manages input enabling/disabling based on current phase

#### Phase 2: Piece Locking (LOCK)
- When a piece can't move down further, **GameStateController transitions to LOCK phase**
- Each die from the piece is placed in the grid using the dice matrix (properly rotated)
- Dice become **autonomous SimpleDie objects** that manage their own rendering and movement
- **Input is disabled** during the locking process
- GameStateController coordinates the transition through **finite state machine**

#### Phase 3: Match Detection (MATCH)
- **MatchProcessor** scans for groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers
- **Advanced flood-fill algorithm** detects connected groups in all directions
- **Wild dice (*)** match with any number for strategic combinations
- Match detection runs synchronously to avoid race conditions

#### Phase 4: Match Clearing (CLEAR_MATCH)
Different match sizes trigger unique clearing effects:
- **3 Dice**: Standard clear (removes matched dice only)
- **4 Dice**: Line clear (removes entire row or column)
- **5 Dice**: Wild spawn (creates a Wild die at match center)
- **7 Dice**: Area clear (removes 7x7 area around match)
- **9+ Dice**: Grid clear (removes all dice from playing field)

#### Phase 5: Cascade System (CASCADE)
- After matches clear, remaining dice **fall autonomously** under gravity
- **MovementManager** tracks all moving dice with explicit registration/unregistration
- Each die handles its own movement through Phaser's **preUpdate()** system
- New matches may form from falling dice, creating **chain reactions**
- Each cascade level increases the **chain multiplier** using floor(log2(chain_index))
- Process continues until no more matches are found (up to 10 cascade levels max)

#### Phase 6: Return to Spawn (SPAWN)
- After all cascades complete, **GameStateController** returns to SPAWN phase
- **Input is re-enabled** and next piece is requested
- Cycle repeats with new piece spawning at top center

#### Special Mechanics
- **Wild Dice (*)**: Match with any number, created by 5-dice matches
- **Black Dice (X)**: Remove active boosters (Hard/Expert modes only, 1-2% chance)
- **Ultimate Combo**: 3+ adjacent Wild dice upgrade all grid dice with 5x score multiplier

- **InputManager**: Handles both keyboard and touch input with gesture recognition
- **Phase-Based Control**: Input automatically enabled/disabled based on GameStateController phase
- **Auto-repeat**: Held keys repeat with 150ms delay and 50ms repeat rate
- **Touch Gestures**: Swipe detection with 50px threshold and double-tap recognition
- **Input Validation**: 50ms cooldown prevents input spam

**Current Implementation Status**
- ‚úÖ Complete finite state machine with 6 phases managing all game flow
- ‚úÖ Autonomous dice movement through SimpleDie objects with MovementManager tracking
- ‚úÖ Event-driven cascade system with proper phase transitions and input control
- ‚úÖ Real-time responsive design across all screen sizes with debug testing
- ‚úÖ Professional input handling with phase-based enabling/disabling
- ‚úÖ Score tracking with real-time updates and next piece preview
- üîß Game modes configured but UI selection not yet implemented
- üîß Audio system implemented but may need additional sound assets
