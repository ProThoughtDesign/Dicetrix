## Dicetrix

A revolutionary gravity-matching puzzle game that combines Tetris-style falling mechanics with dice-based matching and cascading chain reactions, built for Reddit's Devvit platform using Phaser.js.

### What is Dicetrix?

Dicetrix is an innovative puzzle game where Tetromino-shaped pieces composed of multi-sided dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided) fall into a 10x20 grid. Instead of traditional color matching, players create matches by aligning 3 or more dice with the same number, triggering powerful size-based effects, color boosters, and spectacular cascading chain reactions. The game features five distinct difficulty modes and seamless Reddit integration for competitive leaderboards and social score sharing.

**Current Development Status**: Dicetrix is a comprehensive game framework with all core systems implemented and ready for integration. The game features a complete Phaser.js architecture with Reddit integration, advanced input management, sophisticated audio system, comprehensive booster mechanics, and a fully functional user interface. Players can currently experience the game's polished interface, test all control systems, and interact with the advanced audio and booster management systems.
