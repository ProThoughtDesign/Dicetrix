# Dicetrix

A revolutionary gravity-matching puzzle game that combines Tetris-style piece mechanics with dice-based matching and groundbreaking individual die collision physics. Built for Reddit using Phaser.js and the Devvit platform.

## üéÆ What is Dicetrix?

**Dicetrix** is a revolutionary puzzle game that combines Tetris-style falling pieces with dice-based matching mechanics and groundbreaking **individual die physics**. Unlike traditional Tetris where entire pieces lock as units, each die in a multi-die piece can collide and lock independently, creating dynamic piece fragmentation that adds unprecedented strategic depth.

**Core Gameplay**: Multi-die pieces (containing 1-16 dice each) fall down an 8√ó16 grid. Players control these pieces using keyboard, touch, or on-screen controls. The revolutionary twist is that when some dice in a piece hit obstacles and lock to the grid, the remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece. Players create matches by connecting 3+ adjacent dice with the same number to clear them and score points.

**What Makes It Special**: Dicetrix is the first puzzle game to successfully merge three distinct gaming mechanics:
1. **Tetris-style spatial reasoning** - fitting and rotating falling pieces
2. **Dice-based number matching** - creating connected groups of matching numbers  
3. **Individual die collision physics** - pieces dynamically fragment based on terrain

This creates a unique three-dimensional puzzle challenge where players must simultaneously consider piece placement, number positioning, and fragmentation prediction.

### The Revolutionary Individual Die Physics

**What Makes Dicetrix Unique:**
Unlike traditional Tetris where entire pieces lock as units, **each die in a multi-die piece can collide and lock independently**. This creates dynamic scenarios where:

- A T-shaped piece might have its center die lock while the arms continue falling
- A 4-die line could have its bottom 2 dice lock while the top 2 continue as a smaller piece
- An L-shape might fragment when only part of it encounters obstacles

**Strategic Impact:**
- **Terrain-Based Strategy**: Existing grid layout affects how new pieces will fragment
- **Fragmentation Prediction**: Players must anticipate how pieces will break apart
- **Continuous Action**: Gameplay flows continuously without traditional piece-locking pauses
- **Triple Challenge**: Balance spatial fitting + number matching + fragmentation prediction

### Difficulty Modes

- **üü¢ Easy** (3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice, 1000ms): Perfect for learning mechanics
- **üü° Medium** (4√ó4√ó8 pieces, d6/d8/d10/d12 dice, 800ms): Recommended starting point

## üöÄ What Makes Dicetrix Innovative?

### Revolutionary Individual Die Physics System

**The Core Innovation**: Dicetrix introduces a groundbreaking collision detection system where each die in multi-die pieces can collide and lock independently. This creates dynamic gameplay scenarios impossible in traditional puzzle games:

- **Dynamic Piece Fragmentation**: Multi-die pieces naturally break apart as individual dice encounter obstacles - a T-shaped piece might have its center die lock while the arms continue falling
- **Terrain-Based Strategy**: Players must predict how pieces will fragment based on the existing grid layout - uneven terrain causes pieces to break apart in unique ways  
- **Continuous Action**: Unlike Tetris where pieces lock as complete units, Dicetrix pieces can partially lock while remaining dice continue falling, maintaining constant gameplay flow
- **Strategic Depth**: Combines traditional spatial reasoning with fragmentation prediction and number matching - players must think in three dimensions simultaneously
- **Bottom-Left Coordinate System**: Uses intuitive Y=0 at bottom physics where pieces fall by decreasing Y coordinates (Y=19‚Üí18‚Üí17‚Üí...‚Üí0)

**Technical Implementation**: Each game tick processes every die individually for collision detection using a bottom-up approach. When a piece falls, each die checks for collisions against the bottom boundary (Y<0), grid walls, and existing pieces. Only dice that would collide are immediately locked to the grid using the `lockCell()` method, while remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece. The system processes dice from bottom to top so newly locked dice become obstacles for dice above them in the same tick.

### Enhanced Difficulty System with Procedural Generation

**Procedural Piece Generation**: The enhanced difficulty system uses the ProceduralPieceGenerator to create pieces within dimensional constraints based on the selected mode:

- **Easy Mode**: 3√ó3√ó5 constraints (max 3 width, 3 height, 5 dice per piece) with d4, d6, d8 dice and 50% booster chance
- **Medium Mode**: 4√ó4√ó8 constraints with d6, d8, d10, d12 dice and 35% booster chance  
- **Hard Mode**: 5√ó5√ó10 constraints with d8, d10, d12, d20 dice, Black Dice enabled, and 25% booster chance
- **Expert Mode**: 5√ó5√ó16 constraints with d10, d12, d20 dice, Black Dice enabled, and 15% booster chance
- **Zen Mode**: 3√ó3√ó5 constraints with d4, d6, d8 dice, uniform dice rule (all dice in a piece have same face count), and 50% booster chance

**Black Die Mechanics**: Advanced modes (Hard/Expert) feature special Black Dice managed by the BlackDieManager that act as wild cards for matching and trigger powerful area conversion effects. When Black Dice are cleared in matches, they transform surrounding dice in a 3√ó3 grid to d20 dice with rerolled numbers, creating opportunities for massive cascade chain reactions.

**Booster Effect System**: The BoosterEffectSystem applies visual glow effects to dice based on difficulty-specific percentages. Nine different glow colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, teal, magenta, cyan) create vibrant visual variety with multi-layered concentric circle rendering for stunning effects.

### Three-Dimensional Puzzle Challenge

Dicetrix successfully merges three distinct gaming mechanics that have never been combined before:

1. **Tetris-Style Pieces**: 8 different multi-die shapes (single die, lines, L-shapes, squares, and T-shapes) fall down a 10√ó20 grid
2. **Dice Matching**: Create connected groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers to clear them and score points
3. **Individual Die Physics**: Revolutionary system where each die can collide and lock independently, creating dynamic piece fragmentation

**Example Scenarios**:
- A 4-die line piece encounters an obstacle with its bottom die ‚Üí that die locks immediately at the collision point, while the remaining 3 dice continue falling as a smaller line piece
- An L-shaped piece hits uneven terrain ‚Üí some dice lock in gaps while others continue falling until they encounter their own obstacles
- A T-piece approaches the bottom ‚Üí the center die locks first when it hits Y=0, while the side dice continue falling until they also reach the bottom or hit existing pieces
- A square piece hits uneven terrain ‚Üí bottom dice lock while top dice continue falling as a horizontal line piece

**Strategic Complexity**: This creates unprecedented strategic depth where players must simultaneously consider:
- Traditional Tetris spatial reasoning and piece rotation
- Dice number positioning for optimal matching opportunities
- Predicting how pieces will dynamically fragment based on terrain
- Setting up cascade chain reactions for bonus scoring
- Managing dimensional constraints and Black Die mechanics in advanced modes

### Core Gameplay Loop

**Piece Movement & Control**: Multi-die pieces spawn at Y=16 (above the visible 8√ó16 grid) and fall automatically with configurable speeds. Players control them using responsive on-screen buttons (3√ó2 grid of 128√ó128 pixel buttons), keyboard controls (WASD/arrows), or touch input. Each piece contains 1-4 dice with numbered faces based on the selected difficulty mode.

**Individual Die Physics**: As pieces fall, each die is checked for collisions independently using bottom-up processing. When some dice hit obstacles (Y<0 boundary, walls, or existing pieces), they lock to the grid immediately using `lockCell()` while remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece. This creates dynamic piece fragmentation based on terrain.

**Matching & Scoring**: Players create matches by connecting 3+ adjacent dice with the same number (horizontal/vertical only) using flood-fill detection. Matched groups disappear immediately, and remaining dice fall to fill gaps using gravity application, potentially creating cascade chain reactions for bonus scoring with multipliers.

**Progressive Difficulty**: Five modes with enhanced dimensional constraints:
- **Easy**: 3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice, 1000ms fall speed, 1.0x multiplier
- **Medium**: 4√ó4√ó8 pieces, d6/d8/d10/d12 dice, 800ms fall speed, 1.1x multiplier  
- **Hard**: 5√ó5√ó10 pieces, d8/d10/d12/d20 + Black Dice, 600ms fall speed, 1.25x multiplier
- **Expert**: 5√ó5√ó16 pieces, d10/d12/d20 + Black Dice, 400ms fall speed, 1.5x multiplier
- **Zen**: 3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice (uniform rule), 1200ms fall speed, 0.9x multiplier

### Revolutionary Individual Die Collision Physics System

The game's signature innovation is its **individual die collision detection system**. Unlike traditional Tetris where entire pieces lock as units, Dicetrix features groundbreaking physics where each die in a multi-piece can collide independently:

**Individual Die Collision System**:
- Each game timer tick checks every die in the active piece for collision individually
- Dice that hit obstacles (bottom, boundaries, or existing pieces) lock to the grid immediately  
- Remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece until they also hit obstacles

### üéØ Game Objective

**Primary Goal**: Create connected groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers to clear them and score points while managing falling multi-die pieces that can fragment dynamically.

**Victory Condition**: There is no traditional "win" state - the goal is to achieve the highest score possible before the grid fills up.

**Game Over**: The game ends when a new piece cannot spawn due to collision at the spawn position (Y=16 above the visible grid).

### üéÆ Game Controls

**On-Screen Control Grid (3√ó2 layout with 128√ó128 pixel buttons)**:
- **Top Row**: ‚Ü∫ (rotate clockwise) | ‚áä (soft drop) | ‚Üª (rotate counter-clockwise)  
- **Bottom Row**: ‚Üê (move left) | ‚áì (hard drop) | ‚Üí (move right)

**Keyboard Controls**:
- **Arrow Keys**: ‚Üê ‚Üí (move horizontally), ‚Üì (soft drop), ‚Üë (rotate clockwise)
- **WASD**: A/D (move left/right), S (soft drop), W (rotate clockwise)  
- **Additional**: Q (rotate counter-clockwise), Space (hard drop), Esc (pause)

**Touch/Mobile Controls**:
- **Tap Controls**: Use the responsive 128√ó128 pixel on-screen button grid for all actions
- **Board Touch**: Tap grid positions to move pieces horizontally toward the touched column using coordinate conversion
- **Responsive Design**: Controls automatically scale with proper touch target sizing for mobile accessibility

### üé≤ Step-by-Step Gameplay Guide

#### Step 1: Understanding the Game Board

**Game Interface Layout**:
- **Centered Game Board**: 8√ó16 main game grid with prominent score display above
- **Next Piece Preview**: 4√ó4 grid positioned beside the board showing upcoming piece
- **Control Section**: 3√ó2 scaled control button layout with 128√ó128 pixel buttons
- **Coordinate System**: Bottom-left origin where Y=0 is at the bottom, Y=15 is at the top
- **Visual Elements**: Green grid lines, dark blue background, and color-coded dice with enhanced gold numbers

#### Step 2: Master the 8 Piece Types

**Available Pieces**:
- **Single Die**: 1 die piece for precise placement
- **Line Pieces**: Line2 (2 dice), Line3 (3 dice), Line4 (4 dice) - horizontal formations
- **L-Shaped Pieces**: L3 (3 dice), L4 (4 dice) - corner formations
- **Square**: 2√ó2 formation of 4 dice
- **T-Shape**: 4 dice in T formation

**Piece Behavior**:
- **Spawning**: Pieces spawn at Y=16 (above the visible grid) and fall automatically
- **Movement**: Use keyboard, touch, or on-screen controls to move and rotate pieces
- **Individual Die Physics**: Each die in a piece can collide and lock independently
- **Dynamic Fragmentation**: Pieces break apart as individual dice hit obstacles

#### Step 3: Master Individual Die Physics (The Revolutionary System)

**How It Works**:
1. **Independent Collision**: Each die in a multi-die piece is checked for collisions individually every game tick
2. **Selective Locking**: Only dice that hit obstacles (bottom boundary, walls, or existing pieces) lock to the grid immediately
3. **Dynamic Fragmentation**: Remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece until they also collide
4. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Dice are processed from lowest Y to highest Y so newly locked dice become obstacles for dice above them

**Real Examples**:
- **T-Piece Fragmentation**: Center die hits an obstacle and locks, while the two arm dice continue falling separately
- **Line Piece Partial Landing**: Bottom 2 dice of a 4-dice line lock when hitting existing pieces, top 2 continue as a smaller line
- **L-Piece Terrain Interaction**: Corner die locks in a gap, while the rest continues falling and may fragment further
- **Square Split**: Bottom row locks on uneven terrain, top row continues falling as a horizontal line

#### Step 4: Create Dice Matches

**Matching Rules**:
- **Objective**: Connect 3+ adjacent dice showing the same number
- **Adjacency**: Only horizontal and vertical connections count (no diagonal)
- **Detection**: Advanced flood-fill algorithm finds all connected groups automatically
- **Clearing**: Matched groups disappear with animated visual feedback and specialized sound effects

**Dice Types by Difficulty**:
- **Easy Mode**: d4 (numbers 1-4) and d6 (numbers 1-6)
- **Medium Mode**: Adds d8 (numbers 1-8) and d10 (numbers 1-10)
- **Hard Mode**: Adds d12 (numbers 1-12)
- **Expert Mode**: Adds d20 (numbers 1-20) for ultimate challenge
- **Zen Mode**: Same as Medium but with relaxed timing and no cascades

#### Step 5: Trigger Cascade Chain Reactions

**Cascade System** (Disabled in Zen Mode):
1. **Match Clearing**: When matches are cleared, remaining dice fall using column-based gravity
2. **Chain Formation**: Falling dice can form new matches automatically, creating cascade chains
3. **Multiplier Bonus**: Each cascade level increases your score multiplier (1x ‚Üí 2x ‚Üí 3x ‚Üí 4x+)
4. **Audio Feedback**: Special combo sound effects play for chain multipliers
5. **Strategic Setup**: Plan initial matches to create maximum chain reactions

**Scoring Formula**: Points = (match size √ó dice number + total die faces) √ó cascade multiplier

#### Step 6: Advanced Strategy

**Triple-Layer Strategy** (The Core Challenge):
1. **Spatial Reasoning**: Traditional Tetris-style piece fitting and rotation planning
2. **Number Positioning**: Strategic placement for optimal dice matching opportunities
3. **Fragmentation Prediction**: Anticipating how pieces will break apart when hitting terrain

**Pro Tips**:
- **Terrain Management**: Create strategic gaps and platforms to control piece fragmentation
- **Height Control**: Keep top rows (Y=14-15) clear to prevent spawn collision game over
- **Cascade Planning**: Set up matches that will cause falling dice to form additional matches
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for opportunities to create large matches (5, 7, 9+ dice) for bonus scoring
- **Audio Cues**: Listen to specialized dice-match sound effects to understand match sizes without looking

### üéØ The Revolutionary Individual Die Physics System

**What Makes This System Unique**:

Dicetrix introduces a groundbreaking collision detection system that processes each die individually during every game tick. This creates unprecedented gameplay scenarios where multi-die pieces can partially lock while remaining dice continue falling.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Bottom-Up Processing**: Dice are processed in Y-ascending order (bottom first) so that newly locked dice become obstacles for dice above them
- **Per-Die Collision Detection**: Each die checks independently against bottom boundary (Y<0), grid boundaries, and existing pieces
- **Selective Locking**: Only dice that would collide are locked immediately using `gameBoard.lockCell()` method
- **Dynamic Piece Updates**: Successfully locked dice are removed from the active piece using safe array management
- **Coordinate System**: Uses bottom-left coordinates (Y=0 at bottom) with FALL_STEP (-1) for intuitive downward movement
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks, boundary validation, and position clamping ensure robust collision handling

**Gameplay Impact**:
- **Natural Piece Breaking**: Multi-die pieces fragment based on terrain they encounter, not predetermined patterns
- **Strategic Depth**: Players must predict how pieces will break apart when planning moves and rotations
- **Continuous Action**: Unlike traditional Tetris, pieces don't lock as complete units - gameplay flows continuously
- **Terrain-Based Strategy**: Existing grid layout directly affects how new pieces will fragment and where dice will land

**Example Scenarios**:
- A 4-die line piece hits an obstacle with its bottom die ‚Üí that die locks immediately, remaining 3 dice continue falling as a smaller line
- An L-shaped piece encounters uneven terrain ‚Üí some dice lock in gaps while others continue falling until they hit obstacles
- A T-piece hits the bottom ‚Üí center die locks first at Y=0, side dice continue falling until they also hit the bottom or existing pieces

This system transforms traditional Tetris spatial reasoning into a multi-dimensional puzzle requiring players to think about piece placement, number matching, AND dynamic fragmentation simultaneously.

## Summary

**Dicetrix** is a complete, production-ready puzzle game that revolutionizes the genre by combining Tetris-style piece mechanics with dice-based matching and groundbreaking individual die collision physics. 

**Key Features**:
- üéÆ **Complete Game Experience**: Professional scene flow from animated splash screen to game over
- üöÄ **Revolutionary Physics**: Individual die collision system where pieces dynamically fragment
- üé≤ **Strategic Depth**: Balance spatial reasoning, number matching, and fragmentation prediction
- üéµ **Algorithmic Audio System**: Complete procedural music compositions and comprehensive sound effects
- üì± **Multi-Platform**: Responsive design with keyboard, touch, and on-screen controls
- üéØ **5 Difficulty Modes**: Progressive challenge from Easy (d4-d6) to Expert (d4-d20)
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Cascade System**: Chain reactions and gravity physics (disabled in Zen mode)
- üåü **Smooth Animations**: Physics-free background bouncing and visual effects
- üèóÔ∏è **Professional Architecture**: TypeScript, Phaser.js, comprehensive error handling

**What Makes It Special**: Unlike traditional Tetris where pieces lock as complete units, Dicetrix features innovative individual die collision physics where each die can hit obstacles independently. This creates unique strategic depth where players must simultaneously consider piece placement, number matching, and dynamic piece fragmentation based on terrain.

**Core Innovation**: The individual die physics system processes each die separately during every game tick, allowing multi-die pieces to partially lock while remaining dice continue falling. This transforms traditional spatial reasoning into a multi-dimensional puzzle requiring players to predict how pieces will fragment when encountering obstacles.

Built for Reddit using the Devvit platform, Dicetrix represents an evolution in puzzle gaming that challenges players to think in multiple dimensions simultaneously while managing an 8√ó16 grid with bottom-left coordinate physics.
