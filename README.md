# Dicetrix

A revolutionary gravity-matching puzzle game that combines Tetris-style piece mechanics with dice-based matching and groundbreaking individual die collision physics. Built for Reddit using Phaser.js and the Devvit platform.

## üéÆ What is Dicetrix?

Dicetrix is an innovative puzzle game that merges the spatial challenge of Tetris with dice-based number matching and revolutionary individual die physics. Players control falling multi-die pieces on an 8√ó16 grid, where each die can collide and lock independently, creating dynamic piece fragmentation that adds unprecedented strategic depth to puzzle gaming.

The game features a complete Reddit integration system with leaderboards, score submission, automated resets, and community features, making it a fully-featured social gaming experience within the Reddit ecosystem.

## üéØ Core Gameplay Mechanics

**Revolutionary Individual Die Physics**: Unlike traditional Tetris where entire pieces lock as units, each die in a multi-die piece can collide and lock independently. When some dice in a piece hit obstacles and lock to the grid, the remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece, creating dynamic piece fragmentation.

**Dice Matching System**: Players create matches by connecting 3+ adjacent dice with the same number (horizontal/vertical only). Matched groups disappear and trigger cascade chain reactions as remaining dice fall to fill gaps, creating opportunities for bonus scoring with increasing multipliers.

**Multi-Layered Strategy**: Dicetrix challenges players to master three simultaneous gameplay dimensions:
1. **Spatial Reasoning** - Traditional Tetris-style piece fitting and rotation
2. **Number Matching** - Strategic dice placement for optimal matching opportunities  
3. **Fragmentation Prediction** - Anticipating how pieces will break apart based on terrain

**Complete Social Experience**: Features comprehensive Reddit integration with difficulty-specific leaderboards, automated score submission, periodic resets, user notifications, and community engagement through the Devvit platform.

### The Revolutionary Individual Die Physics

**What Makes Dicetrix Unique:**
Unlike traditional Tetris where entire pieces lock as units, **each die in a multi-die piece can collide and lock independently**. This creates dynamic scenarios where:

- A T-shaped piece might have its center die lock while the arms continue falling
- A 4-die line could have its bottom 2 dice lock while the top 2 continue as a smaller piece
- An L-shape might fragment when only part of it encounters obstacles

**Strategic Impact:**
- **Terrain-Based Strategy**: Existing grid layout affects how new pieces will fragment
- **Fragmentation Prediction**: Players must anticipate how pieces will break apart
- **Continuous Action**: Gameplay flows continuously without traditional piece-locking pauses
- **Triple Challenge**: Balance spatial fitting + number matching + fragmentation prediction

### Difficulty Modes

- **üü¢ Easy** (3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice, 1000ms): Perfect for learning mechanics
- **üü° Medium** (4√ó4√ó8 pieces, d6/d8/d10/d12 dice, 800ms): Recommended starting point  
- **üî¥ Hard** (5√ó5√ó10 pieces, d8/d10/d12/d20 + Black Dice, 600ms): Challenging gameplay
- **üü† Expert** (5√ó5√ó16 pieces, d10/d12/d20 + Black Dice, 400ms): Ultimate challenge
- **üü£ Zen** (3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice uniform, 1200ms): Relaxed, no cascades

### Scoring System

**Basic Scoring**: Points = (match size √ó dice number + total die faces) √ó cascade multiplier

**Cascade Chains**: When matches clear, remaining dice fall and can form new matches automatically, creating chain reactions with increasing multipliers (2x, 3x, 4x+).

**Special Features**:
- **Black Dice** (Hard/Expert): Wild matching + 3√ó3 area conversion to d20 dice
- **Booster Effects**: Glowing dice provide visual assistance (frequency varies by difficulty)
- **Audio Feedback**: Different sounds for 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9+ dice matches

## üöÄ What Makes Dicetrix Innovative?

### Revolutionary Individual Die Physics System

**The Core Innovation**: Dicetrix introduces a groundbreaking collision detection system where each die in multi-die pieces can collide and lock independently. This creates dynamic gameplay scenarios impossible in traditional puzzle games:

- **Dynamic Piece Fragmentation**: Multi-die pieces naturally break apart as individual dice encounter obstacles
- **Terrain-Based Strategy**: Players must predict how pieces will fragment based on the existing grid layout
- **Continuous Action**: Unlike Tetris where pieces lock as complete units, Dicetrix pieces can partially lock while remaining dice continue falling
- **Strategic Depth**: Combines traditional spatial reasoning with fragmentation prediction and number matching
- **Bottom-Left Coordinate System**: Uses intuitive Y=0 at bottom physics where pieces fall by decreasing Y coordinates

**Real Examples**:
- A T-shaped piece might have its center die lock while the arms continue falling
- A 4-die line could have its bottom 2 dice lock while the top 2 continue as a smaller piece  
- An L-shape might fragment when only part of it encounters obstacles
- A square piece could split with bottom dice locking while top dice continue falling

**Technical Implementation**: Each game tick processes every die individually for collision detection using a bottom-up approach. Only dice that would collide are immediately locked to the grid, while remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece.

### Enhanced Difficulty System with Procedural Generation

**Procedural Piece Generation**: The enhanced difficulty system uses the ProceduralPieceGenerator to create pieces within dimensional constraints based on the selected mode:

- **Easy Mode**: 3√ó3√ó5 constraints (max 3 width, 3 height, 5 dice per piece) with d4, d6, d8 dice and 50% booster chance
- **Medium Mode**: 4√ó4√ó8 constraints with d6, d8, d10, d12 dice and 35% booster chance  
- **Hard Mode**: 5√ó5√ó10 constraints with d8, d10, d12, d20 dice, Black Dice enabled, and 25% booster chance
- **Expert Mode**: 5√ó5√ó16 constraints with d10, d12, d20 dice, Black Dice enabled, and 15% booster chance
- **Zen Mode**: 3√ó3√ó5 constraints with d4, d6, d8 dice, uniform dice rule (all dice in a piece have same face count), and 50% booster chance

**Black Die Mechanics**: Advanced modes (Hard/Expert) feature special Black Dice managed by the BlackDieManager that act as wild cards for matching and trigger powerful area conversion effects. When Black Dice are cleared in matches, they transform surrounding dice in a 3√ó3 grid to d20 dice with rerolled numbers, creating opportunities for massive cascade chain reactions.

**Booster Effect System**: The BoosterEffectSystem applies visual glow effects to dice based on difficulty-specific percentages. Nine different glow colors (red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, teal, magenta, cyan) create vibrant visual variety with multi-layered concentric circle rendering for stunning effects.

### Three-Dimensional Puzzle Challenge

Dicetrix successfully merges three distinct gaming mechanics that have never been combined before:

1. **Tetris-Style Pieces**: Procedurally generated multi-die shapes fall down an 8√ó16 grid
2. **Dice Matching**: Create connected groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers to clear them and score points
3. **Individual Die Physics**: Revolutionary system where each die can collide and lock independently, creating dynamic piece fragmentation

**Example Scenarios**:
- A 4-die line piece encounters an obstacle with its bottom die ‚Üí that die locks immediately at the collision point, while the remaining 3 dice continue falling as a smaller line piece
- An L-shaped piece hits uneven terrain ‚Üí some dice lock in gaps while others continue falling until they encounter their own obstacles
- A T-piece approaches the bottom ‚Üí the center die locks first when it hits Y=0, while the side dice continue falling until they also reach the bottom or hit existing pieces

**Strategic Complexity**: This creates unprecedented strategic depth where players must simultaneously consider:
- Traditional Tetris spatial reasoning and piece rotation
- Dice number positioning for optimal matching opportunities
- Predicting how pieces will dynamically fragment based on terrain
- Setting up cascade chain reactions for bonus scoring
- Managing dimensional constraints and Black Die mechanics in advanced modes

### Core Gameplay Loop

**Piece Movement & Control**: Multi-die pieces spawn at Y=16 (above the visible 8√ó16 grid) and fall automatically with configurable speeds. Players control them using responsive on-screen buttons (3√ó2 grid of 128√ó128 pixel buttons), keyboard controls (WASD/arrows), or touch input. Each piece contains 1-16 dice with numbered faces based on the selected difficulty mode.

**Individual Die Physics**: As pieces fall, each die is checked for collisions independently using bottom-up processing. When some dice hit obstacles (Y<0 boundary, walls, or existing pieces), they lock to the grid immediately using `lockCell()` while remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece. This creates dynamic piece fragmentation based on terrain.

**Matching & Scoring**: Players create matches by connecting 3+ adjacent dice with the same number (horizontal/vertical only) using flood-fill detection. Matched groups disappear immediately, and remaining dice fall to fill gaps using gravity application, potentially creating cascade chain reactions for bonus scoring with multipliers.

**Progressive Difficulty**: Five modes with enhanced dimensional constraints:
- **Easy**: 3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice, 1000ms fall speed, 1.0x multiplier
- **Medium**: 4√ó4√ó8 pieces, d6/d8/d10/d12 dice, 800ms fall speed, 1.1x multiplier  
- **Hard**: 5√ó5√ó10 pieces, d8/d10/d12/d20 + Black Dice, 600ms fall speed, 1.25x multiplier
- **Expert**: 5√ó5√ó16 pieces, d10/d12/d20 + Black Dice, 400ms fall speed, 1.5x multiplier
- **Zen**: 3√ó3√ó5 pieces, d4/d6/d8 dice (uniform rule), 1200ms fall speed, 0.9x multiplier

### Game Objective

**Primary Goal**: Create connected groups of 3+ adjacent dice with matching numbers to clear them and score points while managing falling multi-die pieces that can fragment dynamically.

**Victory Condition**: There is no traditional "win" state - the goal is to achieve the highest score possible before the grid fills up.

**Game Over**: The game ends when a new piece cannot spawn due to collision at the spawn position (Y=16 above the visible grid).

### Understanding the Game Interface

**Left Side (Main Game Area - 60% of screen)**:
- **Score Display**: Current score shown at the top in gold text with black stroke for visibility
- **Main Grid**: 8√ó16 playing field with green grid lines and dark blue background
- **Bottom-Left Coordinates**: Y=0 is at the bottom, Y=15 is at the top of the visible grid (intuitive physics)
- **Visual Feedback**: Dice are rendered with colors based on type and clearly show their face numbers in gold
- **Active Pieces**: Multi-die pieces fall and can be controlled until individual dice lock to the grid

**Right Side (Controls & Info - 40% of screen)**:
- **Next Piece Preview**: 4√ó4 grid showing the upcoming piece with grid-aligned positioning
- **Control Panel**: 3√ó2 grid of interactive control buttons with clear symbols (‚Ü∫ ‚áä ‚Üª / ‚Üê ‚áì ‚Üí)
- **Booster Slots**: 3√ó3 grid for visual booster effects display

### Mastering Individual Die Physics (The Key Innovation)

**How It Works**:
1. **Independent Collision**: Each die in a multi-die piece is checked for collisions individually every game tick
2. **Selective Locking**: Only dice that hit obstacles (bottom boundary, walls, or existing pieces) lock to the grid immediately
3. **Dynamic Fragmentation**: Remaining dice continue falling as a smaller active piece until they also collide
4. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Dice are processed from lowest Y to highest Y so newly locked dice become obstacles for dice above them

**Real Examples**:
- **T-Piece Fragmentation**: Center die hits an obstacle and locks, while the two arm dice continue falling separately
- **Line Piece Partial Landing**: Bottom 2 dice of a 4-dice line lock when hitting existing pieces, top 2 continue as a smaller line
- **L-Piece Terrain Interaction**: Corner die locks in a gap, while the rest continues falling and may fragment further
- **Square Split**: Bottom row locks on uneven terrain, top row continues falling as a horizontal line

### Creating Dice Matches

**Matching Rules**:
- **Objective**: Connect 3+ adjacent dice showing the same number
- **Adjacency**: Only horizontal and vertical connections count (no diagonal)
- **Detection**: Advanced flood-fill algorithm finds all connected groups automatically
- **Clearing**: Matched groups disappear with animated visual feedback and specialized sound effects

**Dice Types by Difficulty**:
- **Easy Mode**: d4 (numbers 1-4), d6 (numbers 1-6), d8 (numbers 1-8)
- **Medium Mode**: d6 (numbers 1-6), d8 (numbers 1-8), d10 (numbers 1-10), d12 (numbers 1-12)
- **Hard Mode**: d8 (numbers 1-8), d10 (numbers 1-10), d12 (numbers 1-12), d20 (numbers 1-20) + Black Dice
- **Expert Mode**: d10 (numbers 1-10), d12 (numbers 1-12), d20 (numbers 1-20) + Black Dice
- **Zen Mode**: d4 (numbers 1-4), d6 (numbers 1-6), d8 (numbers 1-8) with uniform dice rule

### Triggering Cascade Chain Reactions

**Cascade System** (Disabled in Zen Mode):
1. **Match Clearing**: When matches are cleared, remaining dice fall using column-based gravity
2. **Chain Formation**: Falling dice can form new matches automatically, creating cascade chains
3. **Multiplier Bonus**: Each cascade level increases your score multiplier (1x ‚Üí 2x ‚Üí 3x ‚Üí 4x+)
4. **Audio Feedback**: Special combo sound effects play for chain multipliers
5. **Strategic Setup**: Plan initial matches to create maximum chain reactions

**Scoring Formula**: Points = (match size √ó dice number + total die faces) √ó cascade multiplier

### Advanced Strategy Tips

**Triple-Layer Strategy** (The Core Challenge):
1. **Spatial Reasoning**: Traditional Tetris-style piece fitting and rotation planning
2. **Number Positioning**: Strategic placement for optimal dice matching opportunities
3. **Fragmentation Prediction**: Anticipating how pieces will break apart when hitting terrain

**Pro Tips**:
- **Terrain Management**: Create strategic gaps and platforms to control piece fragmentation
- **Height Control**: Keep top rows (Y=14-15) clear to prevent spawn collision game over
- **Cascade Planning**: Set up matches that will cause falling dice to form additional matches
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for opportunities to create large matches (5, 7, 9+ dice) for bonus scoring
- **Audio Cues**: Listen to specialized dice-match sound effects to understand match sizes without looking
- **Black Die Strategy**: In Hard/Expert modes, position Black Dice for maximum area conversion impact
