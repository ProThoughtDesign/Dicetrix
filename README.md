## Dicetrix

A revolutionary gravity-matching puzzle game that combines Tetris-style falling mechanics with dice-based matching and cascading chain reactions, built for Reddit's Devvit platform using Phaser.js.

### What is Dicetrix?

Dicetrix is an innovative puzzle game where Tetromino-shaped pieces composed of multi-sided dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided) fall into a 10x20 grid. Instead of traditional color matching, players create matches by aligning 3 or more dice with the same number, triggering powerful size-based effects, color boosters, and spectacular cascading chain reactions. The game features five distinct difficulty modes and seamless Reddit integration for competitive leaderboards and social score sharing.

**Current Development Status**: Dicetrix is a comprehensive game framework with all core systems implemented and ready for integration. The game features a complete Phaser.js architecture with Reddit integration, advanced input management, sophisticated audio system, comprehensive booster mechanics, and a fully functional user interface. Players can currently experience the game's polished interface, test all control systems, and interact with the advanced audio and booster management systems.

## Getting Started

> Make sure you have Node 22 downloaded on your machine before running!

### Quick Start (Existing Project)
1. Clone or download this Dicetrix project
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open the provided Reddit playtest URL to experience the game

### New Installation
1. Run `npm create devvit@latest --template=phaser`
2. Go through the installation wizard. You will need to create a Reddit account and connect it to Reddit developers
3. Copy the command on the success page into your terminal

### Testing the Current Implementation

#### Step-by-Step Demo Instructions

1. **Launch the Game**:
   - Run `npm run dev` in your terminal
   - Open the provided Reddit playtest URL in your browser
   - Experience the complete scene flow: Boot â†’ Preloader â†’ MainMenu â†’ Game

2. **Experience the Loading Process**:
   - Watch the Boot scene quickly load essential preloader assets
   - Observe the beautiful "Loading Dicetrix..." preloader with:
     - Real-time progress bar (0-100%)
     - Current asset name display
     - Neon green branding on dark space background
   - See the smooth fade transition to the Main Menu

3. **Navigate the Main Menu**:
   - View the "DICETRIX - Tap to Play" splash screen
   - Notice the responsive scaling that adapts to your screen size
   - Tap anywhere to transition to the game scene

4. **Explore the Interactive Game Scene**:
   - Read the comprehensive control instructions displayed on screen
   - Note the persistent score and level display in the top-left corner
   - See the audio button (ðŸ”Š) in the top-right corner for audio settings
   - View the "Game Over" button in the bottom-right for scene navigation testing

5. **Test the Advanced Input System**:
   - Click the "Test Input System" button to activate comprehensive input testing
   - Try different input methods and watch real-time feedback:
     - **Keyboard**: Use arrow keys, space bar, and ESC with auto-repeat functionality
     - **Touch**: Swipe in different directions and try tap/double-tap gestures
     - **Visual Feedback**: Each input displays as yellow text showing event type and source

6. **Test the Complete Audio System**:
   - Click the "Test Audio System" button to experience the full audio framework
   - Listen to the sequence of sound effects demonstrating all game audio events
   - Click the audio button (ðŸ”Š) to open the audio settings panel
   - Adjust volume sliders for master, music, and sound effects independently
   - Toggle music and sound effects on/off to test the enable/disable functionality
   - Notice how settings are automatically saved to localStorage

7. **Verify Advanced Features**:
   - **Movement Controls**: Arrow keys move with auto-repeat when held down
   - **Rotation**: Up arrow or tap triggers rotation events
   - **Hard Drop**: Space bar or double-tap triggers hard drop events
   - **Gesture Recognition**: Swipe detection works in all four directions
   - **Input Validation**: Rapid inputs are properly rate-limited and validated
   - **Audio Feedback**: All input actions trigger appropriate sound effects when audio testing is active

8. **Test Game Mechanics**:
   - **Pause System**: Press ESC to see pause functionality (visual indicator appears)
   - **Fall Timer**: Automatic piece dropping system is ready for integration
   - **Lock Delay**: 500ms grace period system for last-second piece adjustments
   - **Collision Detection**: Movement validation prevents invalid piece placement
   - **Audio Integration**: Game controller connects with audio events for immersive feedback

9. **Test Responsive Design**:
   - Resize your browser window to see automatic layout adjustments
   - Verify UI elements reposition correctly for different screen sizes
   - Test on mobile devices to confirm touch gesture recognition
   - Notice how the audio settings panel adapts to different screen sizes

10. **Verify Server Integration**:
    - Score and level data automatically persist across browser sessions
    - Game state initializes through Reddit API (`/api/game/init`)
    - User authentication handled seamlessly through Reddit context
    - Audio settings persist across sessions using localStorage

11. **Scene Navigation Testing**:
    - Click "Game Over" button to test smooth scene transitions with red-tinted background
    - Return to main menu and re-enter game to verify state persistence
    - Experience consistent performance across all scene transitions
    - Notice how audio continues seamlessly across scene changes
