# Responsive UI System Requirements

## Introduction

The Responsive UI System ensures that Dicetrix provides an optimal gaming experience across all device types and screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors and fullscreen displays. The system must dynamically adapt layouts, scaling, and UI elements based on screen dimensions and orientation while maintaining consistent gameplay mechanics and visual quality.

## Glossary

- **Responsive_UI_System**: The complete adaptive interface system that handles dynamic scaling and layout
- **Display_Mode**: The current screen classification (Mobile, Desktop, Fullscreen)
- **Layout_Manager**: Component responsible for calculating and applying responsive layouts
- **Scaling_Factor**: Dynamic multiplier used to scale UI elements based on screen size
- **UI_Zone**: Defined areas of the screen allocated for specific game elements
- **Grid_Viewport**: The main playing area containing the 10x20 game grid
- **HUD_Elements**: User interface components like score, next piece, and boosters
- **Adaptive_Typography**: Text sizing system that scales based on display mode and element importance
- **Touch_Interface**: Mobile-specific controls and interaction methods
- **Breakpoint_System**: Screen size thresholds that trigger layout changes

4. WHEN updating existing elements, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL maintain game state and piece positions accurately
5. WHEN the adaptation is complete, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL resume normal gameplay without interruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the game, I want all UI measurements to be dynamically calculated from screen dimensions, so that the game remains responsive without hardcoded values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the UI system, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL calculate all measurements from current screen dimensions
2. WHEN defining UI zones, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL use percentage-based or calculated positioning instead of fixed pixel values
3. WHEN scaling elements, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL derive scaling factors from the current display mode and screen size
4. WHEN positioning elements, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL use relative positioning based on grid offset and cell size
5. WHEN updating layouts, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL recalculate all dependent measurements automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player with accessibility needs, I want text and interactive elements to be appropriately sized for my display, so that I can read and interact with the game comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN displaying critical information, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL use high contrast and appropriate font weights
4. WHEN text overlaps with game elements, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL provide sufficient background contrast or spacing
5. WHEN elements are too small for the display, THE Responsive_UI_System SHALL apply minimum size constraints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player using different input methods, I want the game controls to adapt to my device capabilities, so that I can play effectively regardless of input type.

#### Acceptance Criteria
