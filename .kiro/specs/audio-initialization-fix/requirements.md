# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current audio system implementation has a critical issue where Strudel audio initialization hangs indefinitely, preventing music from playing in the game. The logs show that `initAudioOnFirstClick()` is called but never completes, causing the `strudelInitialized` flag to remain false. This results in a loop where the system repeatedly tries to initialize Strudel on every music play request.

## Glossary

- **Strudel**: A JavaScript library for algorithmic music composition and live coding
- **AudioContext**: Web Audio API interface representing an audio-processing graph
- **HybridAudioService**: The service that manages both Strudel (music) and Phaser (SFX) audio systems
- **initAudioOnFirstClick**: Strudel function that initializes the audio context after user interaction

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear background music when I start the game, so that I have an immersive audio experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player interacts with the splash screen, THE HybridAudioService SHALL successfully initialize the Strudel audio system within 2 seconds
2. WHEN Strudel initialization completes, THE HybridAudioService SHALL set the strudelInitialized flag to true
3. WHEN the StartMenu scene loads, THE HybridAudioService SHALL play the menu theme music without hanging
4. IF Strudel initialization fails, THEN THE HybridAudioService SHALL provide a fallback audio solution using Phaser audio
5. WHEN music is requested multiple times, THE HybridAudioService SHALL not attempt to reinitialize Strudel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable audio initialization debugging, so that I can identify and fix audio issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Strudel initialization starts, THE HybridAudioService SHALL log the initialization attempt with timestamp
2. WHEN Strudel initialization completes or fails, THE HybridAudioService SHALL log the result with detailed error information
3. WHEN audio context state changes occur, THE HybridAudioService SHALL log the state transitions
4. IF initialization takes longer than expected, THEN THE HybridAudioService SHALL log timeout warnings
5. WHEN fallback audio is used, THE HybridAudioService SHALL clearly indicate the fallback mode in logs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to work even if advanced audio features fail, so that I can still enjoy the game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF Strudel initialization fails completely, THEN THE HybridAudioService SHALL fall back to Phaser-only audio mode
2. WHEN fallback mode is active, THE HybridAudioService SHALL play simple audio files instead of algorithmic music
3. WHEN in fallback mode, THE HybridAudioService SHALL maintain all audio control functionality (play, stop, volume)
4. IF both Strudel and Phaser audio fail, THEN THE HybridAudioService SHALL operate in silent mode without errors
5. WHEN audio systems recover, THE HybridAudioService SHALL automatically switch back to full functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want timeout protection for audio initialization, so that the game doesn't hang indefinitely waiting for audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Strudel initialization is attempted, THE HybridAudioService SHALL implement a 5-second timeout
2. IF initialization exceeds the timeout, THEN THE HybridAudioService SHALL cancel the initialization and use fallback
3. WHEN timeout occurs, THE HybridAudioService SHALL log the timeout event with diagnostic information
4. AFTER timeout, THE HybridAudioService SHALL not retry Strudel initialization automatically
5. WHERE manual retry is requested, THE HybridAudioService SHALL allow one additional initialization attempt
