# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Splash Screen feature adds an animated introductory screen to Dicetrix that displays before the main menu. The splash screen features falling dice animations with interactive text prompting the user to begin playing, creating an engaging entry point that enhances the game's visual appeal and user experience.

## Glossary

- **Dicetrix_System**: The complete game application including client, server, and Reddit integration
- **Splash_Screen**: An animated introductory scene that displays before the Start Menu
- **Falling_Die**: Individual blank animated dice objects with random color tints that fall from the top of the screen with gravity
- **Spawn_System**: The mechanism that creates new falling dice at random intervals
- **Gravity_Effect**: Downward physics applied to falling dice objects
- **Flash_Text**: Slowly pulsating text that prompts user interaction
- **Asimovian_Font**: The custom font family used for game text elements
- **Scene_Transition**: The process of moving from Splash Screen to Start Menu

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see an engaging animated splash screen when the game loads, so that I feel excited to play and understand the game's dice theme.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads after the Preloader scene, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL display the Splash_Screen before the Start Menu
2. WHEN the Splash_Screen is active, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL spawn 1-3 Falling_Die objects at random intervals between 0.2 and 0.8 seconds
3. WHEN a Falling_Die is spawned, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL place it at a random horizontal position at the top of the screen
4. WHEN a Falling_Die is created, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL apply a random color tint to the blank die texture
5. WHEN Falling_Die objects are active, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL apply steady downward Gravity_Effect to make them fall
6. WHEN a Falling_Die moves completely off the bottom of the screen, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL destroy the object to free memory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear instructions on how to proceed from the splash screen, so that I know how to start playing the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Splash_Screen is displayed, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL show Flash_Text reading "Press any key to play Dicetrix"
2. WHEN displaying the Flash_Text, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL center it horizontally and vertically on the screen
3. WHEN rendering the Flash_Text, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL use the Asimovian_Font family with white color
4. WHEN sizing the Flash_Text, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL scale it to occupy 80% of the screen width with appropriate height
5. WHEN the Flash_Text is active, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL apply a slow pulsing animation to create visual interest

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to easily transition from the splash screen to the game, so that I can start playing without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any keyboard key is pressed during the Splash_Screen, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL trigger a Scene_Transition to the Start Menu
2. WHEN any screen tap or click occurs during the Splash_Screen, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL trigger a Scene_Transition to the Start Menu
3. WHEN a Scene_Transition is triggered, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL initialize the audio services using the user interaction
4. WHEN audio initialization completes, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL stop all Falling_Die animations and spawning
5. WHEN transitioning to the Start Menu, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL clean up all Splash_Screen objects and timers
6. WHEN the Scene_Transition completes, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL display the Start Menu scene with audio services ready

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player on mobile devices, I want the splash screen to work smoothly with touch controls, so that I can interact with the game naturally on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Splash_Screen is displayed on a touch device, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL register touch events for scene transition
2. WHEN a touch event occurs anywhere on the Splash_Screen, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL treat it as equivalent to a key press
3. WHEN multiple rapid touches occur, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL prevent multiple scene transitions
4. WHEN the Splash_Screen is active, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL maintain smooth 60fps animation performance on mobile devices
5. WHEN touch interactions occur, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL provide immediate visual feedback before transitioning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game's audio to work properly after interacting with the splash screen, so that I can enjoy music and sound effects during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user interaction occurs on the Splash_Screen, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL initialize the audio handler services
2. WHEN audio initialization is successful, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL enable background music for subsequent scenes
3. WHEN audio initialization fails, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL continue with scene transition without blocking the user
4. WHEN the Start Menu loads after splash screen interaction, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL have audio services ready for immediate use
5. WHEN audio services are initialized, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log the initialization status for debugging purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the splash screen to integrate seamlessly with the existing game architecture, so that it doesn't disrupt the current scene flow or performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL insert the Splash_Screen between the Preloader and StartMenu scenes
2. WHEN the Splash_Screen is created, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL follow the same architectural patterns as existing scenes
3. WHEN Falling_Die objects are created, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL use efficient object pooling to minimize garbage collection
4. WHEN the Splash_Screen runs, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL maintain the same background color scheme as other game scenes
5. WHEN scene transitions occur, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL preserve all existing game registry data and settings
