## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to submit my score along with my Reddit handle and difficulty level to the subreddit when the game ends, so that my achievement can be recorded in the appropriate leaderboard category.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game ends, THE Game_Client SHALL display a score submission interface with the player's final score and Difficulty_Level
2. WHEN a player chooses to submit their score, THE Game_Client SHALL send the score data, Reddit handle, Difficulty_Level, and Score_Timestamp to the Devvit_Server
3. THE Devvit_Server SHALL create a Reddit post in the hosting subreddit containing the player's score, handle, Difficulty_Level, and Score_Timestamp
4. IF the score submission fails, THEN THE Game_Client SHALL display an error message and allow retry
5. THE Game_Client SHALL provide confirmation when the score is successfully submitted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the system to automatically intercept and parse score submission posts, so that leaderboard data can be maintained without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. IF parsing fails, THEN THE Devvit_Server SHALL log the error without affecting other system operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want the system to maintain separate leaderboards for each difficulty level with configurable reset intervals, so that competitive gameplay can be tracked fairly across different skill levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN a Leaderboard_Reset occurs, THE Leaderboard_System SHALL clear all scores for the specified time period while preserving historical data
6. THE Leaderboard_System SHALL provide API endpoints for retrieving leaderboard data by Difficulty_Level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to configure leaderboard reset intervals, so that competitive seasons can be managed according to community preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Leaderboard_System SHALL provide configuration options for Leaderboard_Reset intervals including daily, weekly, monthly, and custom periods
2. THE Leaderboard_System SHALL default to daily Leaderboard_Reset when no configuration is specified

4. THE Leaderboard_System SHALL maintain historical leaderboard data for at least the previous 3 reset periods
5. THE Leaderboard_System SHALL provide API endpoints for retrieving both current and historical leaderboard data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a community member, I want the system to automatically post leaderboard results and notify top players when a leaderboard period ends, so that achievements are celebrated and shared with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Leaderboard_Reset is triggered, THE Devvit_Server SHALL create a Leaderboard_Post containing the top 5 players for each Difficulty_Level from the completed time period
2. THE Leaderboard_Post SHALL include player Reddit handles, scores, difficulty levels, Score_Timestamp of achievements, and the time period covered
3. THE Devvit_Server SHALL attempt to send Player_Notification messages to the top 5 players in each Difficulty_Level about their achievement
4. IF Player_Notification delivery fails, THEN THE Devvit_Server SHALL log the failure without affecting the Leaderboard_Post creation
5. THE Leaderboard_Post SHALL be formatted for readability and include appropriate congratulatory messaging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a subreddit visitor, I want to view the current leaderboards for each difficulty level on the subreddit's main page, so that I can see top players without entering the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Devvit_Server SHALL provide a Subreddit_Widget that displays current leaderboard standings for each Difficulty_Level
2. THE Subreddit_Widget SHALL show player Reddit handles and their corresponding Top_Score for each Difficulty_Level
3. THE Subreddit_Widget SHALL update automatically when new scores are submitted

5. WHERE the subreddit has moderator permissions, THE Subreddit_Widget SHALL be visible on the main page

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to access leaderboards for each difficulty level from within the game's start menu, so that I can check rankings before or after playing.
