# Task Logging Reminder

## For Future Task Implementations

When completing any task, make sure to update the AI diary using the logging utility:

```typescript
import { logTaskCompletion } from '../../../shared/utils/ai-logger.js';

// At the end of each task implementation:
logTaskCompletion(
  taskNumber,           // e.g., 6
  'Task Name',          // e.g., 'Implement game loop and input handling'
  'Brief summary',      // What was accomplished
  ['file1.ts', 'file2.ts'], // Files created/modified
  ['req1', 'req2']      // Requirements satisfied
);
```

## Manual Diary Updates

For more detailed logging, also manually update `.kiro/specs/dicetrix-game/ai-diary.md` with:
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Performance considerations
- Integration points
- Validation results

## Current Status

- ✅ Task 1: Project structure and interfaces - LOGGED
- ✅ Task 5: Match detection system - LOGGED
- ⏳ Tasks 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10: Need logging when implemented

This ensures proper workflow tracking and impact measurement for the Kiro development process.
