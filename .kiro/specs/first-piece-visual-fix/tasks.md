# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add diagnostic logging to identify initialization timing issues


  - Add detailed timing logs to the create() method initialization sequence
  - Log UI system readiness states and board metrics availability
  - Add sprite creation attempt logging with success/failure tracking
  - Log coordinate conversion results for first piece positioning
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 2. Implement system readiness validation

  - Create validateSystemReadiness() method to check all required systems
  - Add UI readiness validation including board metrics and callbacks
  - Implement Phaser scene readiness checks for sprite creation capability
  - Add coordinate converter validation to ensure proper initialization
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 3. Fix first piece spawning timing with delayed initialization

  - Modify create() method to delay first piece spawn until systems are ready
  - Implement async initialization sequence with proper waiting mechanisms
  - Add retry logic for failed first piece spawn attempts with exponential backoff
  - Create fallback mechanisms for initialization timeout scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.1_

- [ ] 4. Enhance sprite creation validation and error handling

  - Add pre-render validation to ensure sprite creation capability
  - Implement sprite creation retry mechanism for failed attempts
  - Add coordinate validation before sprite positioning
  - Create error recovery for corrupted or missing sprite references
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.3, 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Ensure consistent input handling for first piece

  - Validate input system readiness before enabling piece controls
  - Add input validation specifically for first piece movement commands
  - Implement input queue system for commands received during initialization
  - Create consistent input response timing across all pieces
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Add comprehensive error recovery and graceful degradation

  - Implement progressive retry delays for multiple initialization failures
  - Create simplified rendering fallback for system initialization issues
  - Add user notification system for extended initialization delays
  - Create diagnostic reporting for persistent initialization problems
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Create initialization performance monitoring

  - Add timing metrics collection for all initialization phases
  - Implement performance threshold monitoring and alerting
  - Create initialization bottleneck identification and reporting
  - Add cross-browser compatibility validation for timing differences
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Implement visual consistency validation
  - Create automated visual comparison between first and subsequent pieces
  - Add position accuracy validation for first piece placement
  - Implement animation consistency checks across all pieces
