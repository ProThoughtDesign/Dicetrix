# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The game has a visual rendering issue where the first spawned piece is not displayed correctly and doesn't respond to user input, while the logic continues to work in the console. Subsequent pieces work fine. This indicates a timing or initialization problem with the first piece's visual rendering system.

## Glossary

- **Game_Scene**: The main Phaser.js scene class that manages the dice falling game
- **Active_Piece**: The currently falling multi-die piece that the player controls
- **Sprite_System**: The visual rendering system that creates and manages Phaser game objects for dice
- **Game_UI**: The user interface system that handles input and visual elements
- **Coordinate_Converter**: Utility that converts between grid coordinates and screen pixels
- **Render_State**: The visual representation of the current game state

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the first piece to be visible immediately when the game starts, so that I can begin playing without confusion

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Game_Scene initializes, THE Game_Scene SHALL render the first active piece visually within 100ms of spawning
2. WHEN THE first piece is spawned, THE Sprite_System SHALL create visible sprites for all dice in the piece
3. WHEN THE first piece is rendered, THE Active_Piece SHALL be positioned correctly on the game board using the Coordinate_Converter
4. WHEN THE Game_Scene completes initialization, THE Render_State SHALL accurately reflect the current game state
5. WHEN THE first piece spawning occurs, THE Game_Scene SHALL ensure all required dependencies are initialized before rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the first piece to respond to my input controls immediately, so that I can move and rotate it as expected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE player presses movement keys during first piece control, THE Game_Scene SHALL move the Active_Piece and update the visual display
2. WHEN THE player presses rotation keys during first piece control, THE Game_Scene SHALL rotate the Active_Piece and update the visual display  
3. WHEN THE first piece receives input commands, THE Game_UI SHALL process the input and trigger the appropriate piece movement functions
4. WHEN THE first piece movement occurs, THE Sprite_System SHALL update the visual position of all active piece sprites
5. WHEN THE input is processed for the first piece, THE Game_Scene SHALL validate the movement and render the updated state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of the first piece rendering issue, so that I can prevent similar problems in the future

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE Game_Scene initialization sequence runs, THE Game_Scene SHALL log detailed timing information for each initialization step
2. WHEN THE first piece spawning occurs, THE Game_Scene SHALL validate that all required systems are ready before proceeding
3. WHEN THE rendering system processes the first piece, THE Sprite_System SHALL verify successful sprite creation and positioning
4. WHEN THE coordinate conversion occurs for the first piece, THE Coordinate_Converter SHALL validate the calculated screen positions
5. WHEN THE Game_UI system initializes, THE Game_Scene SHALL confirm UI readiness before enabling input processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent behavior between the first piece and all subsequent pieces, so that the game feels polished and reliable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ANY piece spawns in the game, THE Game_Scene SHALL follow the same rendering sequence and timing
2. WHEN THE rendering system processes any piece, THE Sprite_System SHALL use consistent sprite creation and positioning logic
3. WHEN THE game state updates for any piece, THE Render_State SHALL reflect changes with the same visual fidelity
4. WHEN THE input system processes commands for any piece, THE Game_UI SHALL respond with identical behavior patterns
5. WHEN THE coordinate system calculates positions for any piece, THE Coordinate_Converter SHALL produce accurate and consistent results
