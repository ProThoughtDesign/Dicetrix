# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Splash Screen Font Loading feature addresses the issue where the SplashScreen scene attempts to use the "Asimovian" font immediately upon creation, but the font may not be fully loaded yet, causing text to display with fallback fonts. This fix will implement proper font loading logic in the SplashScreen scene, similar to the existing implementation in the StartMenu scene.

## Glossary

- **Dicetrix_System**: The complete game application including client, server, and Reddit integration
- **SplashScreen_Scene**: The animated introductory scene that displays before the Start Menu
- **Font_Loading**: The asynchronous process of loading web fonts before using them in text elements
- **Asimovian_Font**: The sci-fi themed Google Font used throughout the game for UI text
- **Font_Ready_State**: The browser's indication that a font has been successfully loaded and is available for use
- **Flash_Text**: The interactive text element on the splash screen that prompts user interaction

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the splash screen text to display with the correct Asimovian font consistently, so that the game's typography appears professional and matches the visual design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SplashScreen scene is created, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL wait for the Asimovian font to load before creating text elements
2. WHEN font loading is in progress, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL delay text creation until fonts are ready
3. WHEN the Asimovian font is successfully loaded, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL create the Flash_Text using the loaded font
4. WHEN font loading completes, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL ensure text displays with the correct Asimovian typography
5. WHEN the Flash_Text is rendered, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL maintain the same visual appearance as other game scenes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SplashScreen to use the same font loading pattern as other scenes, so that font handling is consistent across the entire game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing font loading in SplashScreen, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL use the same document.fonts.load() method as StartMenu
2. WHEN loading fonts, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL load both Nabla and Asimovian fonts for consistency
3. WHEN font loading promises are created, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL wait for all fonts to be ready before proceeding
4. WHEN font loading is complete, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL continue with the normal scene creation process
5. WHEN font loading fails, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL gracefully fall back to creating text with system fonts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player on slower network connections, I want the splash screen to handle font loading gracefully, so that the game doesn't hang or break if fonts take time to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font loading takes longer than expected, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL implement a reasonable timeout mechanism
2. WHEN font loading times out, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL proceed with text creation using fallback fonts
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL not block the splash screen indefinitely
4. WHEN font loading fails completely, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log the error and continue with scene creation
5. WHEN using fallback fonts, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL maintain text readability and positioning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for font loading, so that font-related issues can be diagnosed and fixed easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font loading begins, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log the font loading attempt for debugging
2. WHEN font loading succeeds, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log successful font initialization
3. WHEN font loading fails, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN using fallback fonts, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log the fallback behavior
5. WHEN font loading times out, THE Dicetrix_System SHALL log the timeout event with timing information
