# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AudioHandler system provides centralized audio management for the Phaser.js game, including sound effects and background music with user-configurable settings. The system will be initialized during the preloader phase and accessible throughout the game lifecycle, with dedicated settings controls for audio preferences.

## Glossary

- **AudioHandler**: The central audio management system that controls all game sounds and music
- **Preloader**: The Phaser.js scene responsible for loading game assets before the main game starts
- **Game Scene**: The main gameplay scene where the core game mechanics occur
- **Settings Scene**: A dedicated scene for configuring game preferences including audio options
- **Sound Effects**: Short audio clips triggered by game events (clicks, matches, etc.)
- **Background Music**: Looping audio tracks that play continuously during gameplay
- **Audio Settings**: User preferences for enabling/disabling music and sound effects independently

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to have audio feedback for my actions, so that I feel more engaged with the gameplay experience

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes, THE AudioHandler SHALL load all required audio assets during the preloader phase
2. WHEN a game event occurs that requires audio feedback, THE AudioHandler SHALL play the appropriate sound effect
3. WHEN the player performs actions in the game, THE AudioHandler SHALL provide immediate audio response
4. THE AudioHandler SHALL be accessible from any game scene that requires audio functionality
5. WHEN audio assets fail to load, THE AudioHandler SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the game

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want background music to enhance the gaming atmosphere, so that I have a more immersive experience

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. THE AudioHandler SHALL persist audio preference settings between game sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized audio system, so that audio management is consistent and maintainable across the entire game

#### Acceptance Criteria
