# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create AudioHandler service class

  - Implement singleton AudioHandler class in `src/client/game/services/AudioHandler.ts`
  - Define IAudioHandler interface with methods for music, sound effects, and settings
  - Implement initialization method that accepts a Phaser scene reference
  - Add internal state management for audio settings and current music track
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Implement audio asset loading in Preloader


  - Modify Preloader scene to load audio assets (music and sound effect files)
  - Initialize AudioHandler singleton during preloader create phase
  - Add error handling for audio loading failures with graceful degradation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5_

- [ ] 3. Add music playback functionality

  - Implement playMusic, stopMusic, pauseMusic, and resumeMusic methods
  - Add music volume control and looping support
  - Handle browser autoplay restrictions with user interaction detection
  - Integrate music state management with scene transitions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Implement sound effects system

  - Add playSound method with volume parameter support
  - Create sound effect pooling for performance optimization
  - Implement sound volume control independent from music volume
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 5. Create Settings scene for audio controls

  - Create new Settings scene class in `src/client/game/scenes/Settings.ts`
  - Add Settings scene to main game configuration scene list
  - Implement UI layout with toggle buttons for music and sound effects
  - Add back button to return to previous scene
  - _Requirements: 3.1_

- [ ] 6. Implement audio settings persistence

  - Integrate AudioHandler with existing Settings service for preference storage
  - Add setMusicEnabled and setSoundEnabled methods with immediate persistence
  - Load saved audio preferences during AudioHandler initialization
  - Implement default settings fallback when persistence fails
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 4.5_

- [ ] 7. Add audio controls to Settings scene UI

  - Create toggle buttons for music on/off with visual state indicators
  - Create toggle buttons for sound effects on/off with visual state indicators
  - Wire toggle buttons to AudioHandler settings methods
  - Implement immediate audio response when settings are changed
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Integrate AudioHandler with Game scene

  - Add AudioHandler calls to Game scene for gameplay sound effects
  - Implement background music playback during gameplay
  - Add sound effects for game events (matches, cascades, etc.)
  - Ensure audio state persists during scene transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1_

- [ ] 9. Add navigation to Settings scene

  - Add Settings button or menu option to StartMenu scene
  - Implement scene transition from StartMenu to Settings
  - Add Settings access from Game scene (pause menu or similar)
  - Ensure proper scene state management during transitions
  - _Requirements: 3.1_

- [ ] 10. Add audio assets and finalize integration

  - Create audio asset files (background music, sound effects)
  - Update asset loading configuration in Preloader
  - Test audio playback across all scenes
  - Verify settings persistence across game sessions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.5_

- [ ] 11. Write unit tests for AudioHandler

  - Create unit tests for AudioHandler initialization and configuration
  - Test audio settings persistence and retrieval functionality
  - Test volume control and audio state management methods
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 12. Write integration tests for Settings scene
  - Test Settings scene UI interaction with AudioHandler
  - Verify audio settings changes are immediately applied
  - Test scene transitions with audio state consistency
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
