# Reddit Web App Display Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The Reddit Web App Display Fix ensures that Dicetrix properly displays as an interactive web app on Reddit posts with a "Launch App" button that users can click to play the game. Currently, the app creates regular text posts instead of web app posts, making the game completely unplayable on mobile and requiring browser resizing on desktop.

## Glossary

- **Web_App_Post**: A Reddit post type that displays an interactive web application with a "Launch App" button
- **Custom_Post_Type**: Devvit's mechanism for creating posts that display web applications
- **Launch_Button**: The clickable button that appears on Reddit posts to open the web app
- **Post_Handler**: Server-side component responsible for creating and managing web app posts
- **Devvit_Context**: The runtime context provided by Devvit for Reddit integration
- **App_Installation**: The process of installing the Dicetrix app on a subreddit
- **Menu_Action**: Moderator menu item for creating new game posts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Reddit user viewing a Dicetrix post, I want to see a "Launch App" button that I can click to play the game, so that I can access the game directly from the Reddit feed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Dicetrix post is created, THE Post_Handler SHALL use Devvit.addCustomPostType to create a Web_App_Post

3. WHEN a user clicks the Launch_Button, THE system SHALL open the Dicetrix web application in full screen
4. WHEN the web application loads, THE system SHALL display the game interface without requiring browser resizing
5. WHEN viewed on mobile devices, THE Launch_Button SHALL be clearly visible and accessible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a subreddit moderator, I want to create Dicetrix game posts that automatically display the web app interface, so that users can play the game without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the moderator menu action, THE Post_Handler SHALL create a Custom_Post_Type instead of a regular text post
2. WHEN creating a Custom_Post_Type, THE Post_Handler SHALL configure the post to display the web application
3. WHEN the post is created, THE system SHALL automatically include game instructions and branding
4. WHEN multiple posts are created, THE system SHALL ensure each post displays the Launch_Button correctly
5. WHEN posts are viewed across different devices, THE Launch_Button SHALL maintain consistent appearance and functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer installing the Dicetrix app, I want the initial post to be created as a proper web app post, so that users can immediately start playing without configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed on a subreddit, THE App_Installation SHALL trigger creation of a Custom_Post_Type
2. WHEN the initial post is created, THE system SHALL configure it to display the Launch_Button immediately
3. WHEN the installation completes, THE system SHALL verify the post displays correctly
4. WHEN users visit the subreddit after installation, THE system SHALL show a functional game post
5. WHEN the initial post fails to create, THE system SHALL log errors and provide fallback instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Reddit user on mobile, I want the game post to display properly without requiring browser manipulation, so that I can play the game seamlessly on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a Dicetrix post on mobile, THE Launch_Button SHALL be immediately visible and clickable
2. WHEN the Launch_Button is clicked on mobile, THE web application SHALL open in an appropriate mobile view
3. WHEN the game loads on mobile, THE interface SHALL be properly sized for the mobile screen
4. WHEN interacting with the game on mobile, THE controls SHALL be responsive and accessible
5. WHEN switching between portrait and landscape on mobile, THE game SHALL maintain proper display

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the web app post configuration to be robust and handle edge cases gracefully, so that the game remains accessible even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN post creation fails, THE Post_Handler SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN the web app fails to load, THE system SHALL display appropriate error messages to users
3. WHEN Devvit_Context is unavailable, THE Post_Handler SHALL handle the error gracefully
4. WHEN subreddit permissions are insufficient, THE system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN the app is uninstalled and reinstalled, THE Post_Handler SHALL create new posts correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game player, I want the web app to load quickly and display the game interface immediately, so that I can start playing without delays or technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Launch_Button is clicked, THE web application SHALL load within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN the web app loads, THE game interface SHALL be immediately interactive
3. WHEN the game starts, THE system SHALL not require additional user actions to make elements clickable
4. WHEN the game is running, THE interface SHALL maintain responsive behavior
5. WHEN the user returns to Reddit, THE Launch_Button SHALL remain functional for subsequent plays

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify that web app posts work correctly across different Reddit interfaces and devices, so that all users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing on Reddit web interface, THE Launch_Button SHALL display and function correctly
2. WHEN testing on Reddit mobile app, THE web app integration SHALL work properly
3. WHEN testing on different browsers, THE Launch_Button SHALL maintain consistent behavior
4. WHEN testing post creation, THE Custom_Post_Type SHALL be created successfully every time
5. WHEN testing across different subreddits, THE web app posts SHALL display consistently

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the app, I want clear separation between web app post creation and regular Reddit API usage, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows Devvit best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing post creation, THE Post_Handler SHALL use Devvit.addCustomPostType exclusively for game posts
2. WHEN creating menu actions, THE system SHALL use proper Devvit menu item configuration
3. WHEN handling app installation, THE system SHALL use Devvit.addTrigger with AppInstall event
4. WHEN managing post lifecycle, THE system SHALL follow Devvit patterns for web app integration
5. WHEN updating the implementation, THE code SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns between Reddit integration and game logic
