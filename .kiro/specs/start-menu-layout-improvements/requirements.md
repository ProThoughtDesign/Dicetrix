# Start Menu Layout Improvements Requirements

## Introduction

The Start Menu currently has a 2x2 button grid layout below the Start Game button, but there are alignment and sizing issues that need to be addressed. The buttons are not consistently sized and the mute button doesn't properly reflect the actual audio state. This feature improves the visual consistency and functionality of the Start Menu interface.

## Glossary

- **Start_Menu**: The main menu scene displayed when the game loads
- **Button_Grid**: The 2x2 grid of buttons positioned below the Start Game button
- **Settings_Button**: Button that opens the settings menu (top-left position)
- **HowToPlay_Button**: Button that opens the how-to-play screen (top-right position)
- **Leaderboard_Button**: Button that opens the leaderboard (bottom-left position)
- **Audio_Button**: Button that toggles audio on/off (bottom-right position)
- **UI_Scale**: The 2x scaling factor applied to UI elements in the Start Menu
- **Audio_State**: The current state of audio (enabled/disabled) in the game
