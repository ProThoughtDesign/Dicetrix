## Introduction

The current background bouncing system in the Game scene uses Phaser's physics system with world bounds collision detection, but this results in minimal movement (only a few pixels of "twitching") instead of smooth bouncing motion. The system needs to be redesigned to use a logical point-based approach with a rectangular bounding box for proper bouncing behavior.

## Glossary

- **Background_System**: The visual background management system that handles the animated background sprite
- **Logical_Point**: A virtual coordinate point that represents the center position for background movement calculations
- **Bounding_Box**: A rectangular area (80% of screen size) within which the logical point can move
- **Background_Sprite**: The visual sprite that displays the background image, positioned relative to the logical point
- **Game_Scene**: The main Phaser scene where the game is played

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a smoothly bouncing background animation, so that the game feels dynamic and visually engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game scene starts, THE Background_System SHALL create a logical point at the center of the screen
2. WHEN the game scene starts, THE Background_System SHALL create a rectangular bounding box that is 80% of the screen dimensions centered on the screen
3. WHEN the logical point reaches any edge of the bounding box, THE Background_System SHALL reverse the appropriate velocity component to create bouncing behavior
4. THE Background_System SHALL update the logical point position every frame based on its current velocity
5. THE Background_System SHALL position the background sprite offset from the logical point by half the sprite's width and height

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the background animation to be smooth and consistent, so that it doesn't distract from gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Background_System SHALL maintain consistent movement speed regardless of frame rate variations
2. THE Background_System SHALL use delta time for frame-rate independent movement calculations
3. THE Background_System SHALL ensure the background sprite remains visible and properly positioned at all times
4. THE Background_System SHALL remove the current physics-based collision detection system
5. THE Background_System SHALL implement manual collision detection against the bounding box edges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the background system to be maintainable and performant, so that it doesn't impact game performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Background_System SHALL use simple mathematical calculations instead of physics engine features
2. THE Background_System SHALL minimize computational overhead by avoiding unnecessary physics body creation
3. THE Background_System SHALL provide clear logging for debugging movement calculations
4. THE Background_System SHALL clean up resources properly when the scene is destroyed
5. THE Background_System SHALL maintain the existing background sprite depth and visual properties
