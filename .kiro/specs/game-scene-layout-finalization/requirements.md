# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature finalizes the layout of the Game scene in the Dicetrix puzzle game by implementing specific positioning, scaling, and font loading requirements. The Game scene layout needs to be optimized for a 1920x1080 screen resolution with proper element positioning and consistent font usage across the interface.

## Glossary

- **Game_Scene**: The main gameplay scene where players interact with falling dice pieces
- **Asimovian_Font**: Custom font used throughout the game interface for consistent branding
- **Game_Board**: The 10x20 playing grid where dice pieces are placed and matched
- **Next_Piece_Display**: UI element showing the preview of the upcoming piece
- **Control_Buttons**: Interactive UI elements for piece movement and rotation
- **Boosters_Section**: UI area displaying active power-ups and special abilities
- **Screen_Layout**: The arrangement of UI elements optimized for 1920x1080 resolution
- **Font_Loading_System**: Mechanism for loading custom fonts before UI creation
