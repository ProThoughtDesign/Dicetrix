# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current game settings system is fragmented and inconsistent, with settings being modified in multiple locations without proper centralization or persistence. Settings are not properly delegated between scenes, leading to music starting unexpectedly when returning to menus and no persistence between sessions or screens. This feature will implement a centralized settings management system that provides consistent state management, proper persistence, and reliable delegation across all game components.

## Glossary

- **Settings_Manager**: The centralized service responsible for managing all game settings
- **Audio_Settings**: Configuration values for music volume, sound volume, music enabled state, and sound enabled state
- **Game_Settings**: Configuration values for gameplay preferences like selected difficulty mode
- **Settings_Persistence**: The mechanism for saving and loading settings between game sessions
- **Settings_Delegation**: The process of properly distributing settings changes to all relevant game components
- **Settings_State**: The current values of all settings at any given time

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want my audio settings to persist between game sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure them every time I play.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player changes audio settings, THE Settings_Manager SHALL save the new values to persistent storage
2. WHEN the game starts, THE Settings_Manager SHALL load previously saved settings from persistent storage
3. WHEN no saved settings exist, THE Settings_Manager SHALL use predefined default values
4. WHEN settings fail to load, THE Settings_Manager SHALL use default values and log the error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want audio settings changes to take effect immediately across all game screens, so that I can hear the changes as I adjust them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player changes music volume, THE Settings_Manager SHALL immediately update all active music playback
2. WHEN the player changes sound volume, THE Settings_Manager SHALL immediately update all sound effect playback
3. WHEN the player toggles music enabled state, THE Settings_Manager SHALL immediately start or stop music playback
4. WHEN the player toggles sound enabled state, THE Settings_Manager SHALL immediately enable or disable sound effects
5. WHEN settings change in one screen, THE Settings_Manager SHALL propagate changes to all other active screens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want music to behave consistently when navigating between screens, so that it doesn't unexpectedly start or stop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player navigates from game to settings, THE Settings_Manager SHALL maintain current music state
2. WHEN the player returns from settings to game, THE Settings_Manager SHALL restore previous music state
3. WHEN the player returns to menu from game, THE Settings_Manager SHALL transition music appropriately based on settings
4. WHEN music is disabled in settings, THE Settings_Manager SHALL prevent any music from playing until re-enabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want all settings to be managed from a single source of truth, so that there are no conflicts or inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs settings values, THE Settings_Manager SHALL provide the current values
2. WHEN any component changes settings, THE Settings_Manager SHALL be the only component that modifies the values
3. WHEN settings are accessed, THE Settings_Manager SHALL ensure thread-safe access to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN multiple components request the same setting, THE Settings_Manager SHALL return consistent values

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want settings changes to be validated and handled gracefully, so that invalid values don't break the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid volume values are provided, THE Settings_Manager SHALL clamp them to valid ranges (0.0 to 1.0)
2. WHEN invalid boolean values are provided, THE Settings_Manager SHALL convert them to valid boolean values
3. WHEN invalid game mode values are provided, THE Settings_Manager SHALL use the default game mode
4. WHEN settings corruption is detected, THE Settings_Manager SHALL reset to defaults and log the issue

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API for settings management, so that I can easily integrate settings into new components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components need to read settings, THE Settings_Manager SHALL provide a simple get method
2. WHEN components need to update settings, THE Settings_Manager SHALL provide a simple set method
3. WHEN components need to listen for changes, THE Settings_Manager SHALL provide an event subscription system
4. WHEN components are destroyed, THE Settings_Manager SHALL allow unsubscription from events to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the settings system to be modular and extensible, so that I can easily add new settings types without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new setting types are added, THE Settings_Manager SHALL support them without modifying existing code
2. WHEN settings schema changes, THE Settings_Manager SHALL handle migration from old formats gracefully
3. WHEN new validation rules are needed, THE Settings_Manager SHALL allow pluggable validators
4. WHEN new persistence mechanisms are required, THE Settings_Manager SHALL support multiple storage backends

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want visual setting indicators to always reflect the actual stored values, so that I can trust what I see in the settings interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings UI is displayed, THE Settings_Manager SHALL ensure visual indicators match stored values
2. WHEN settings change programmatically, THE Settings_Manager SHALL update all visual indicators immediately
3. WHEN returning to settings screens, THE Settings_Manager SHALL restore visual indicators to current stored values
4. WHEN settings are reset, THE Settings_Manager SHALL update both stored values and visual indicators simultaneously
