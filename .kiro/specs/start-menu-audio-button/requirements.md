# Start Menu Audio Button Requirements

## Introduction

The Start Menu currently has a Settings button positioned centrally below the start button. This feature adds an audio control button to enable users to activate audio context directly from the menu without entering the game, improving the user experience by allowing immediate audio feedback and music playback.

## Glossary

- **Start_Menu**: The main menu scene displayed when the game loads
- **Settings_Button**: The existing button that opens the settings menu
- **Audio_Button**: The new square button with muted speaker icon for audio control
- **Audio_Context**: Web Audio API context that must be activated by user interaction
- **Difficulty_Dropdown**: The existing mode selection dropdown in the Start Menu
- **UI_Scale**: The 2x scaling factor applied to UI elements in the Start Menu

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the Settings button to be aligned with the Difficulty dropdown, so that the menu layout looks more organized and balanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Start Menu loads, THE Settings_Button SHALL be positioned to align its left edge with the left edge of the Difficulty_Dropdown
2. WHEN the UI_Scale is applied, THE Settings_Button SHALL maintain its alignment with the Difficulty_Dropdown
3. WHEN screen size changes, THE Settings_Button SHALL preserve its left alignment with the Difficulty_Dropdown
4. WHEN the Settings_Button is repositioned, THE Settings_Button SHALL maintain its existing styling and functionality
5. WHEN the Settings_Button is clicked, THE Settings_Button SHALL continue to open the Settings scene as before

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want a dedicated audio button next to the Settings button, so that I can easily activate audio without having to start the game first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Start Menu loads, THE Audio_Button SHALL be positioned to the right of the Settings_Button with appropriate spacing
2. WHEN the Audio_Button is created, THE Audio_Button SHALL be square-shaped with the same height as the Settings_Button
3. WHEN the Audio_Button is displayed, THE Audio_Button SHALL show a muted speaker icon to indicate audio is off
4. WHEN the UI_Scale is applied, THE Audio_Button SHALL scale proportionally with other UI elements
5. WHEN the Audio_Button is hovered, THE Audio_Button SHALL provide visual feedback similar to other interactive elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want clicking the audio button to immediately activate audio and start playing music, so that I can hear the game's audio without entering gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Audio_Button is clicked, THE Start_Menu SHALL force a refresh of the audio context to comply with browser policies
2. WHEN the audio context is refreshed, THE Start_Menu SHALL initialize the audio system if not already initialized
3. WHEN audio initialization completes successfully, THE Start_Menu SHALL begin playing the menu theme music
4. WHEN music starts playing, THE Audio_Button SHALL update its icon to show an unmuted speaker
5. IF audio initialization fails, THEN THE Start_Menu SHALL log the error and keep the muted speaker icon

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the audio button to toggle between muted and unmuted states, so that I can control audio playback from the menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Audio_Button shows a muted speaker icon and is clicked, THE Audio_Button SHALL attempt to enable audio and play music
2. WHEN the Audio_Button shows an unmuted speaker icon and is clicked, THE Audio_Button SHALL stop music playback
3. WHEN music is stopped, THE Audio_Button SHALL change its icon back to a muted speaker
4. WHEN audio state changes, THE Audio_Button SHALL provide immediate visual feedback of the current state
5. WHEN the Audio_Button state changes, THE Start_Menu SHALL play appropriate sound effects if audio is enabled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the audio button implementation to integrate cleanly with existing audio systems, so that it doesn't interfere with current audio handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Audio_Button activates audio, THE Start_Menu SHALL use the existing enableAudioOnUserInteraction method
2. WHEN audio is initialized through the Audio_Button, THE Start_Menu SHALL follow the same initialization flow as other user interactions
3. WHEN the Audio_Button controls music, THE Start_Menu SHALL use the existing audioHandler service methods
4. WHEN the Audio_Button changes audio state, THE Start_Menu SHALL maintain compatibility with existing audio state management
5. WHEN other menu interactions occur after Audio_Button use, THE Start_Menu SHALL not reinitialize audio unnecessarily

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player using different devices, I want the audio button to work consistently across desktop and mobile platforms, so that I have the same audio control experience everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Audio_Button is displayed on mobile devices, THE Audio_Button SHALL maintain appropriate touch target size
2. WHEN the Audio_Button is used on desktop, THE Audio_Button SHALL respond to mouse interactions with hover effects
3. WHEN the Audio_Button activates audio on any platform, THE Audio_Button SHALL handle browser-specific audio context requirements
4. WHEN screen orientation changes on mobile, THE Audio_Button SHALL maintain its position relative to the Settings_Button
5. WHEN the UI scales for different screen sizes, THE Audio_Button SHALL remain proportional and functional

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual indication of the audio button's purpose and state, so that I understand what it does and whether audio is currently active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is inactive, THE Audio_Button SHALL display a muted speaker icon with clear visual styling
2. WHEN audio is active, THE Audio_Button SHALL display an unmuted speaker icon with distinct visual styling
3. WHEN the Audio_Button is hovered, THE Audio_Button SHALL show hover effects that indicate it's interactive
4. WHEN the Audio_Button is pressed, THE Audio_Button SHALL provide immediate visual feedback of the click
5. WHEN the Audio_Button state changes, THE Audio_Button SHALL animate the transition between muted and unmuted icons

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the code, I want the audio button implementation to be clean and maintainable, so that future modifications are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Audio_Button, THE Start_Menu SHALL create reusable methods for audio state management
2. WHEN the Audio_Button handles clicks, THE Start_Menu SHALL use clear, well-named event handler methods
3. WHEN the Audio_Button updates its appearance, THE Start_Menu SHALL use consistent styling patterns with other UI elements
4. WHEN the Audio_Button manages audio state, THE Start_Menu SHALL follow existing error handling patterns
5. WHEN the Audio_Button code is written, THE Start_Menu SHALL include appropriate comments explaining the audio context requirements
