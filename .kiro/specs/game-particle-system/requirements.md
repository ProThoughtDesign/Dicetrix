# Particle System Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing a comprehensive particle system in the Dicetrix game. The particle system will enhance visual feedback, create engaging effects for game events, and improve the overall player experience through dynamic visual elements.

## Glossary

- **Particle_System**: The core system managing creation, update, and rendering of visual particle effects
- **Particle_Emitter**: A component that generates and controls individual particle effects
- **Match_Event**: When dice with matching numbers are detected and removed from the game board
- **Cascade_Event**: When gravity causes pieces to fall after matches are cleared, potentially creating chain reactions
- **Piece_Placement**: The moment when a falling piece locks into position on the game board
- **Combo_Multiplier**: A scoring mechanism that increases when multiple matches occur in sequence
- **Special_Dice**: Dice with enhanced properties like boosters or black dice with special effects
- **Game_State_Transition**: Events like game over, level completion, or high score achievements
- **Performance_Budget**: Maximum computational resources allocated to particle effects to maintain 60fps gameplay

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Particle System Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth and responsive particle effects that don't impact game performance, so that I can enjoy enhanced visuals without gameplay lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes, THE Particle_System SHALL create a pooled particle management system with configurable maximum particle counts
2. WHEN particles are created, THE Particle_System SHALL reuse existing particle objects to minimize garbage collection
3. WHEN the frame rate drops below 50fps, THE Particle_System SHALL automatically reduce particle density to maintain performance
4. WHEN particles exceed the Performance_Budget, THE Particle_System SHALL prioritize newer effects over older ones
5. WHERE performance settings are available, THE Particle_System SHALL allow users to adjust particle quality levels

### Requirement 2: Match Event Particle Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want satisfying visual feedback when I make matches, so that I feel rewarded for successful moves and can clearly see the results of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Match_Event occurs, THE Particle_System SHALL create explosion effects at each matched dice position
2. WHEN dice matches involve different dice types, THE Particle_System SHALL use color-coded particles matching the dice colors
3. WHEN larger matches occur, THE Particle_System SHALL scale particle intensity proportionally to match size
4. WHEN multiple matches happen simultaneously, THE Particle_System SHALL create distinct effects for each match group
5. WHILE match particles are active, THE Particle_System SHALL ensure particles don't obscure remaining gameplay elements

### Requirement 3: Cascade and Combo Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want increasingly dramatic effects for combo chains, so that I can feel the excitement building with each successive match.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Cascade_Event triggers, THE Particle_System SHALL create falling particle trails following the moving dice
2. WHEN the Combo_Multiplier increases, THE Particle_System SHALL intensify particle effects with each combo level
3. WHEN combo chains reach high multipliers, THE Particle_System SHALL add special celebration effects like fireworks
4. WHEN cascades create new matches, THE Particle_System SHALL blend cascade and match effects smoothly
5. IF combo chains exceed 5x multiplier, THEN THE Particle_System SHALL create screen-wide celebration effects

### Requirement 4: Piece Placement and Movement Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual feedback for piece movements and placements, so that I can better understand the game physics and feel connected to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Piece_Placement occurs, THE Particle_System SHALL create impact effects at the placement location
2. WHEN pieces rotate, THE Particle_System SHALL create subtle rotation trail effects around the piece
3. WHEN pieces move horizontally, THE Particle_System SHALL create motion blur or trail effects
4. WHEN pieces fall rapidly, THE Particle_System SHALL create speed-based particle trails
5. WHILE pieces are in motion, THE Particle_System SHALL ensure effects don't interfere with piece visibility

### Requirement 5: Special Dice and Booster Effects

**User Story:** As a player, I want special dice and boosters to have distinctive visual effects, so that I can easily identify their special properties and feel their enhanced power.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Special_Dice appear, THE Particle_System SHALL create glowing aura effects around enhanced dice
2. WHEN booster dice are activated, THE Particle_System SHALL create energy burst effects
3. WHEN black dice (wild cards) are used, THE Particle_System SHALL create magical transformation effects
4. WHEN special abilities trigger, THE Particle_System SHALL create unique particle signatures for each ability type
5. WHILE special dice are active, THE Particle_System SHALL maintain subtle ambient effects to indicate their status

### Requirement 6: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want particle effects to enhance my experience without causing performance issues, so that I can enjoy smooth gameplay on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on mobile devices, THE Particle_System SHALL automatically adjust quality settings for optimal performance
2. WHEN particle count exceeds limits, THE Particle_System SHALL implement culling strategies to maintain frame rate
3. WHEN memory usage is high, THE Particle_System SHALL efficiently manage particle object pools
4. WHILE effects are active, THE Particle_System SHALL maintain consistent 60fps performance
5. WHERE hardware limitations exist, THE Particle_System SHALL gracefully degrade effect quality

### Requirement 7: Customization and Settings

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control particle effect intensity, so that I can customize the visual experience to my preferences and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings, THE Particle_System SHALL provide particle quality options (Low, Medium, High, Ultra)
2. WHEN particle settings change, THE Particle_System SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring restart
3. WHEN effects are disabled, THE Particle_System SHALL maintain core gameplay functionality
4. WHILE customizing settings, THE Particle_System SHALL provide real-time preview of effect changes
5. WHERE accessibility is needed, THE Particle_System SHALL support reduced motion options for sensitive users
