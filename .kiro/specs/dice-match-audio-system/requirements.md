# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature updates the audio documentation and sound event triggers for Dicetrix to properly reflect dice-matching gameplay mechanics instead of line-clearing mechanics. The current AUDIO_ASSETS_DOCUMENTATION.md file lists Tetris-style "line-clear" sound effects that don't match the dice-matching nature of the game. This update will correct the documentation to list appropriate dice-matching sound effects and ensure the existing audio system calls the right sound events.

## Glossary

- **Audio_Documentation**: The AUDIO_ASSETS_DOCUMENTATION.md file that specifies required sound effects
- **Dice_Match_Events**: Sound events triggered when players successfully match dice groups
- **Sound_Event_Triggers**: Code locations where audio playback is initiated based on game events
- **Match_Size**: The number of dice involved in a single matching event (3, 4, 5, 7, 9 dice)
- **Chain_Multiplier**: A scoring multiplier from consecutive matches
- **Ultimate_Combo**: A special high-value multiplier from exceptional play

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the audio documentation to list dice-matching sound effects instead of line-clearing effects, so that the documentation accurately reflects the game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL replace line-clear-single with dice-match-3 sound effect specification
2. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL replace line-clear-double with dice-match-4 sound effect specification  
3. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL replace line-clear-triple with dice-match-5 sound effect specification
4. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL replace line-clear-tetris with dice-match-7 sound effect specification
5. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL add dice-match-9 sound effect specification for large matches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing combo sound effects to be properly documented for dice-matching context, so that chain multipliers have appropriate audio feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL maintain combo-2x sound effect for 2x Chain_Multiplier events
2. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL maintain combo-3x sound effect for 3x Chain_Multiplier events
3. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL maintain combo-4x sound effect for 4x+ Chain_Multiplier events
4. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL update descriptions to reference dice-matching chains instead of generic combos

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ultimate combo sound effects documented for dice-matching achievements, so that exceptional plays have appropriate audio celebration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL specify ultimate-combo sound effect for Ultimate_Combo multiplier events
2. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL maintain perfect-clear sound effect for complete board clearing
3. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL describe these effects in dice-matching terminology

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all non-matching sound effects preserved in the documentation, so that existing gameplay audio continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL preserve all piece-placement, piece-rotation, piece-drop, and piece-hold specifications
2. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL preserve all UI sound specifications (button-click, menu-navigate, settings-change, mode-select)
3. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL preserve all game state sound specifications (level-up, game-over, pause, resume)
4. THE Audio_Documentation SHALL preserve all warning and alert sound specifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sound event triggers updated to call dice-matching sounds, so that the correct audio plays during gameplay without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE sound events exist for line-clearing, THE Sound_Event_Triggers SHALL be updated to call dice-matching sound effects instead
2. THE Sound_Event_Triggers SHALL maintain all existing non-matching sound event calls
3. THE Sound_Event_Triggers SHALL handle missing audio files gracefully during development
4. THE Sound_Event_Triggers SHALL not break existing gameplay functionality
